[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km.

Here's how to solve it:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at 62 km/h**

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled at 124 km/h**

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance**

Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
Total Distance = 124 km + 372 km = 596 km


**Answer:** The total distance traveled is 596 km.

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km.

Here's how to solve it:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at 62 km/h**

Distance = Speed x Time 
Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled at 124 km/h**

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance**

Total Distance = 124 km + 372 km = 596 km


**Answer:** The total distance traveled is 596 km.
