**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the pens:** The student bought pens costing $2 each, and she has $50, so the pens will cost her $2 * (number of pens)
2. **Find the amount left for the pens:** She has $50 - $18 (book) = $32 left for the pens.
3. **Determine the number of pens:** She can buy $32 / $2 = 16 pens.

**Final answer:** The student can buy 16 pens. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the money remaining:**  The student starts with $50 and spends $18 on the book, leaving her with $50 - $18 = $32.
2. **Calculate the total cost of the pens:** The pens cost $2 each, and she wants to buy them with the remaining money.  The total cost of the pens is $2 * number of pens.
3. **Set up an equation:** We know the total cost of the pens must be less than or equal to $32.  Let 'n' represent the number of pens. The equation is: $2 * n <= $32
4. **Solve for 'n':**  Divide both sides of the equation by $2: n <= 16 

**Final Answer:** The student can buy 16 pens.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Year 1 depreciation:**  The car loses 30% of its value, so it's worth 70% of its original price ($5600).  
2. **Year 2 depreciation:** The car loses 20% of the value it has after year 1, meaning it's worth 80% of its value after year 1 ($5600 * 0.80). 
3. **Original price:** We can set up an equation to solve for the original price. Let 'x' be the original price.

**Equation:**

*  70% of x = $5600 

**Solving for x:**

1. **Convert percentage to decimal:** 70% = 0.70
2. **Set up the equation:** 0.70x = $5600

**Reasoning:**

1. **Year 1:** The car loses 30% of its value, meaning it's worth 70% of its original price. We can express this as: 
   Original Price * 0.70 = $5600
2. **Year 2:**  The car loses 20% of its value, meaning it's worth 80% of what it was last year. We can express this as:
   $5600 * 0.80 = $4480
3. **Year 1 Value:** The value after Year 1 is $5600.
4. **Year 2 Value:** The value after Year 2 is $4480.

Now we can use these values to find the original price:

1. **Year 1 Depreciation:** The car loses 30% of its value, which means it's worth 70% of its original price ($5600 is 70% of the original price).

2. **Year 2 Depreciation:** The car loses 20% of its remaining value from year 1, which is 0.20 * $5600 = $1120.

3. **Year 2 Value:**  The car's value after year 1 is $5600, and it loses $1120 in year 2, so its value after year 2 is $5600 - $1120 = $4480.

4. **Year 1 Value:** The car's value after year 2 is $4480, which is 70% of the original price.
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Let's represent the original price with a variable:** Let 'x' be the original price of the car.

2. **Year 1 Value:**  After the first year, the value decreases by 30%. The new value is: x - 0.30x = 0.70x

3. **Year 2 Value:**  The value decreases again by 20% of the value from year 1. So, the new value is: 0.70x - 0.20(0.70x) = 0.56x

4. **We know the final value:** We're given that the final value is $5600, which is equal to 0.56x.

5. **Solve for the original price (x):**
    * 0.56x = 5600

reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Year 1 Depreciation:** The car loses 30% of its value in year 1.  This means the value is now 70% of its original price (100% - 30% = 70%).
2. **Year 1 Value:** We know the value after year 1 is $5600.  Therefore, we can set up an equation: 0.7 * Original Price = $5600
3. **Solve for Original Price:** Divide both sides of the equation by 0.7:
   Original Price = $5600 / 0.7 
   Original Price = $8000

**Final answer:** The original price of the car was $8000.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Find the cost of one pen:** Since 5 pens cost $3, one pen costs $3 / 5 = $0.60.
2. **Calculate the total cost:** The teacher buys 45 pens, so the total cost is 45 * $0.60 = $27.00.


**Final Answer:** $27.00 

reward is 0.9

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the cost per pen:** $3 / 5 pens = $0.60 per pen.
2. **Multiply the cost per pen by the number of pens:** $0.60 per pen * 45 pens = $27.00.

**Final answer:** $27.00

**Step 1:** Figure out how many sets of pens the teacher buys.
   - Divide the total number of pens by the number of pens per set: 45 pens / 5 pens/set = 9 sets.

**Step 2:** Calculate the cost of each set.
   - Multiply the price per set by the number of sets: $3/set * 9 sets = $27.

**Final Answer:** The teacher pays $27. 

reward is 0.9

**Step 1:**  Calculate how many sets of pens the teacher buys.
 
 **Step 2:** Calculate the cost of one set of pens. 

**Step 3:** Calculate the total cost.

**Step 4:**  Give the final answer.


Let's break it down:

**Step 1:** The teacher buys 45 pens.  Since each set has 5 pens, divide the number of pens by 5: 45 pens / 5 pens/set = 9 sets.

**Step 2:** The cost of one set is $3 for 5 pens.  Divide the price by the number of pens per set: $3 / 5 pens/set = $0.60 per pen.

**Step 3:**  The total cost is the cost per pen multiplied by the number of sets: $0.60 per pen * 9 sets = $5.40
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Step 1:** Figure out how many sets of pens the teacher buys.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Area of the garden:** The garden has an area of 12 m * 18 m = 216 square meters.
2. **Area of the garden with path:**  The path adds an extra area that must be calculated.  Let's subtract the area of the path from the total area.
3. **Calculation of the path area:**
   - The path forms two rectangles on each side. 
   - The side of the rectangle is 12 m + 1 m = 13 m.
   - The length of the rectangle is 18 m.
   - The area of one rectangle is 13 m * 18 m = 234 square meters.
   - The area of the path is 234 square meters * 2 = 468 square meters.


**Final answer:** 468 square meters 

reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the area of the garden:**  Area = length x width = 12 m x 18 m = 216 m².
2. **Calculate the area of the path:** The path is built inside the garden, so it is the area of the garden minus the area of the path that is used for the path. 
   - Area of the path = Area of garden - Area of path used for the path.
3. **Calculate the area of the path used for the path:** The path is 1 m wide, so we need to calculate the area of the rectangle that is formed by the path. 
   - Area of the path used for the path =  length x width = 1 m x 1 m = 1 m².
4. **Calculate the area of the path:**
   - Area of the path = Area of garden - Area of path used for the path
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Area of the garden:** The garden has an area of 12 m * 18 m = 216 m².
2. **Area of the path:** The path is 1 m wide on all sides.  
   -  Imagine the garden as a rectangle. The path is added as a square on each side.  
   -  The area of the path is the sum of the areas of these squares.
3. **Calculate the area of the squares:**
   -  Area of a square = side * side 
   -  The sides of the squares are 12 m, 18 m, 12 m, 18 m
   -  The area of the squares is 12 * 12 = 144 m², 18 * 18 = 324 m² 
4. **Total area of the path
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Area of the garden:** The garden has an area of 12 m * 18 m = 216 square meters.
2. **Area of the path:**  The path is built inside the garden, so we need to find the area of the garden minus the area of the path. 
3. **Area of the path:** The path is 1 m wide, so the total area of the path is 1 m * 1 m * 2 = 2 square meters.
4. **Final area:** The area of the path is 2 square meters.

**Final answer:** 2 square meters 



reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Find the dimensions of the garden with the path:** The path adds 2 sides of length 1 meter to each side of the garden. So the garden dimensions are 12m + 2 * 1m = 14m and 18m + 2 * 1m = 20m.
2. **Calculate the area of the garden:** Area of the garden = 12m * 18m = 216 m².
3. **Calculate the area of the path:** The area of the path is the area of the garden minus the area of the garden minus the area of the path. The area of the path is the area of the garden minus the area of the path.
4. **Calculate the area of the path:** Area of the path = 216 m² - (2 * 1m * 1m) = 216

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the savings percentage:**
   - Savings = 15% of income
   - $420 = 0.15 * Income
   - Income = $420 / 0.15 
   - Income = $2800

2. **Calculate the total income:**
   - Spending = $2380
   - Savings = $420
   - Total income = Income - Spending
   - Total income = $2800 - $2380
   - Total income = $420

**Final answer:** $4200




reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the amount saved:** We know savings are $420 and the percentage saved is 15%.  We can use this to find the total income.
   *  Income = Savings / Percentage saved
   *  Income = $420 / 0.15
   *  Income = $2800

2. **Calculate the amount spent:** We know the family spent $2380 and that's an amount we need to subtract from the total income.
   * Total income - Spending = Savings
   * $2800 - $2380 = $420 

3. **Calculate the total income:** We now know the amount spent and the amount saved, which we can use to find the total income.
   * Total income = Savings + Spending
   * Total income = $420 + $2380

reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the savings percentage:** 
   - We know savings are $420 and the percentage saved is 15%. 
   - We can use the formula: Savings = (Income * Savings Percentage) / 100
   -  420 = (Income * 15) / 100
   - 4200 = Income * 15
   - Income = 4200 / 15
   - **Income = $280** 

2. **Calculate total income:**
   - We know the total spending is $2380 and total income is $280.
   - We can use the formula: Total Income = Spending + Savings
   - 280 + 2380 = **Total Income**
   - **Total Income = $2660**


**Final Answer:**
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the fraction of income saved:** Since savings are $420 and represent 15% of the income, the fraction saved is 420/0.15 = 2800.

2. **Calculate the fraction of income spent:** The family spends $2380, which is 2380/total income.

3. **Equate the fractions saved and spent:**  The fraction saved is equal to the fraction spent: 2800 = 2380/total income.

4. **Solve for total income:** Multiply both sides by total income to get: 2800 * total income = 2380. Then, divide both sides by 2800 to find: total income = 2380 / 2800 = 0.85.

**Final answer:** 0.85
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the savings percentage:**  We know savings are $420 and they spend $2380, so the savings represent 420/2380 = 0.17 or 17% of total income.

2. **Calculate total income:**  We know that the savings percentage is 17%, and we know the savings, so we can use the formula: Total Income = Savings / Savings Percentage.

3. **Plug in the values and solve:** Total Income = $420 / 0.17 = $2470.59

**Final Answer:** $2470.59

*  To find the length of each part, divide the total length by the sum of the ratio parts: 64 m / (5 + 3) = 64 m / 8 = 8 m.

**Step 2:**
Determine which part is shorter.
* The length of the 5 parts is 8 m * 5 = 40 m.
* The length of the 3 parts is 8 m * 3 = 24 m.
* The shorter piece is 24 m.

Final Answer: 24 m.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 5:3 means that the rope is divided into 5 parts of length 5m and 3 parts of length 3m.
2. **Total Length Breakdown:** The total length is 64m, which is the sum of the lengths of all the parts.
3. **Finding the Length of Each Part:**  To find the length of each part, we can use the formula: Length of each part = Total length / Number of parts.
4. **Calculating Length of Each Part:**  
   * Length of each part 5 = 64m / 8 = 8m
   * Length of each part 3 = 64m / 8 = 8m
5. **Comparing Lengths:** The shorter piece is the one with a length of 8m.

**Final Answer:** 8m

   -  Divide the total number of pens by the number of pens per group: 27 pens / 10 pens/group = 2.7 groups.
   -  Since you can't buy a fraction of a group, round up to 3 groups.
   -  Cost of 3 groups: 3 groups * $10/group = $30

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the selling price per item:** 
   - 40% profit = 0.40 * $12 = $4.80
   - Selling price per item = $12 + $4.80 = $16.80

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Total revenue = Selling price per item * Number of items
   - Total revenue = $16.80 * 70 = $1176

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Total profit = $1176 - (70 * $12) = $1176 - $840 = $336

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance for the first part.**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 62 km/h x 2 h = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate the distance for the second part.**

* Speed = 62 km/h x 2 = 124 km/h
* Distance = 124 km/h x 3 h = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance.**

* Total Distance = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

**Answer:** The total distance traveled is 496 km.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Find the sugar-to-flour ratio:** The recipe uses 2 cups of sugar for every 5 cups of flour. This means the ratio is 2:5.

2. **Calculate the total sugar needed:** The baker uses 20 cups of flour. To find the amount of sugar, we can set up a proportion: 
   *  2/5 = x/20
   * Cross-multiply: 2 * 20 = 5 * x
   * Simplify: 40 = 5x
   * Solve for x: x = 8

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**  
   - The discount is 20% of the original price, so let's represent the original price as "x".
   - Discount = 0.20 * x
2. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   - Discounted price = Original price - Discount
   - $72 = x - 0.20x
3. **Solve for the original price (x):**
   - Combine like terms: $72 = 0.80x
   - Divide both sides by 0.80: x = $90

**Final answer:** $90

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   -  The discount is 20% of the original price.
   -  Let 'x' be the original price.
   -  Discount amount = 0.20x

2. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   -  Discounted price = Original price - Discount amount
   -  $72 = x - 0.20x
   -  $72 = 0.80x

3. **Solve for the original price:**
   -  Original price = $72 / 0.80
   -  Original price = $90

**Final answer:** $90 



reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Represent the discount as a decimal:** 20% = 0.20
2. **Calculate the price after the discount:** $72 - (0.20 * $72) = $72 - $14.40 = $57.60
3. **Set up an equation to find the original price:** Original price - 0.20 * Original price = $57.60
4. **Solve for the original price:**
   - 0.80 * Original price = $57.60
   - Original price = $57.60 / 0.80
   - Original price = $72

**Final answer:** $72.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the discount amount:** 
   - 20% of the original price is $72.
   -  $72 * 0.20 = $14.40 

2. **Calculate the price after the discount:**
   -  Original price - discount amount = sale price
   -  $72 - $14.40 = $57.60

3. **Calculate the original price:**
   -  Sale price + discount amount = original price
   - $57.60 + $14.40 = $72.00

**Final answer:** $72.00 

reward is -1.1

**Reasoning:**

1. **Represent the discount:**  Let 'x' be the original price.  The discount is 20% of x, which is 0.20x.
2. **Calculate the price after the discount:** The price after the discount is x - 0.20x = 0.80x.
3. **Set up the equation:** We know the discounted price is $72, so 0.80x = $72.
4. **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 0.80 to get x = $72 / 0.80 = $90.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Rent as a percentage of income:**  We know rent is 30% of their income. 
2. **Calculate income:** Since rent is $900, we can find their total income by dividing the rent by the percentage: $900 / 0.30 = $3000
3. **Food expenses as a percentage of income:** Food expenses are 25% of their income.
4. **Calculate total expenses:**  Total expenses are the sum of rent and food: $900 + ($3000 * 0.25) = $900 + $750 = $1650
5. **Calculate remaining income:**  Their remaining income is the difference between their total income and total expenses: $3000 - $1650 = $1350

**Reasoning:**

1. **Rent as a percentage of income:**  We know that rent is 30% of their income.  
2. **Calculate the income:**  Since rent is $900, we can express this as 0.30x, where x is their income. Therefore, 0.30x = $900.
3. **Solve for income:** Dividing both sides by 0.30 gives us x = $3000.
4. **Food expenses as a percentage of income:** Food expenses are 25% of their income.
5. **Calculate total expenses:**  Their total expenses are 0.25x + $900.
6. **Set up an equation:** We know that total expenses equal their income, so 0.25x + $900 = $3000.
