A farmer harvested 240 apples. He sold 3/5 of them at the market and gave 1/4 of the remainder to a neighbor. How many apples does he have left?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Apples sold:** The farmer sold (3/5) * 240 = 144 apples.
2. **Apples remaining:** After selling some apples, he had 240 - 144 = 96 apples.
3. **Apples given away:** He gave 1/4 * 96 = 24 apples to his neighbor.
4. **Apples left:** He has 96 - 24 = 72 apples left.

**Final answer:** 72

A farmer harvested 240 apples. He sold 3/5 of them at the market and gave 1/4 of the remainder to a neighbor. How many apples does he have left?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> 

Here's the solution:

**1. Apples sold at the market:**

* (3/5) * 240 apples = 144 apples

**2. Apples remaining after selling:**

* 240 apples - 144 apples = 96 apples

**3. Apples given to the neighbor:**

* (1/4) * 96 apples = 24 apples

**4. Apples left:**

* 96 apples - 24 apples = 72 apples

**Final answer: 72**

A farmer harvested 240 apples. He sold 3/5 of them at the market and gave 1/4 of the remainder to a neighbor. How many apples does he have left?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>
 
**Step 1: Calculate the number of apples sold.**
* Multiply the total apples by the fraction sold: 240 * (3/5) = 144 apples
 
**Step 2: Calculate the number of apples remaining after selling.**
* Subtract the apples sold from the total apples: 240 - 144 = 96 apples

**Step 3: Calculate the number of apples given to the neighbor.**
* Multiply the remaining apples by the fraction given away: 96 * (1/4) = 24 apples

**Step 4: Calculate the number of apples remaining after giving to the neighbor.**
* Subtract the apples given away from the remaining apples: 96 - 24 = 72 apples

**Final answer:** 72

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance for the first part**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate the distance for the second part**

* Speed = 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h
* Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance**

* Total distance = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km


**Answer:** The total distance traveled is 496 km.

A builder constructs 180 meters of road in 3 days. Each day he builds 20% more than the previous day. How much does he build on day 1?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> 

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Pattern:**

* The builder builds 20% more each day. This means the percentage increase is 20% of the previous day's output.

**2. Calculate Day 1's Output:**

* Let's say Day 1's output is 'x'. 
* Day 2's output is 1.20x (20% more than x)
* Day 3's output is 1.44x (20% more than 1.20x)

**3.  Use the Total Output:**

* We know the total output for 3 days is 180 meters. 
* This means: x + 1.20x + 1.44x = 180

**4. Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 3.64x =

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* The builder builds 20% more each day, meaning he builds 120% of the previous day's output.

**2. Calculate the Daily Output:**

* **Day 1:**  He builds 180 meters (total) / 3 days = 60 meters per day.

* **Day 2:** 60 meters * 1.20 = 72 meters.

* **Day 3:** 72 meters * 1.20 = 86.4 meters.

Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>

Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the pattern:**

* The builder increases his output each day by 20% of the previous day's amount. This means the amounts built each day form a sequence where each number is 1.20 times the number before it.

**2.  Let's represent the amounts:**

*  Let 'x' represent the amount built on day 1.
*  Day 2: 1.20x 
*  Day 3: 1.20 * 1.20x = 1.44x

**3. Use the total distance:**

* The total distance built in 3 days is 180 meters. 

**4. Set up an equation:**

* x + 1.20x + 1.44x = 180

Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>

Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Understand the percentages:**

* Day 1: 100% 
* Day 2: 100% + 20% = 120% of Day 1
* Day 3: 120% of Day 1 + 20% = 140% of Day 1

**2.  Calculate the total progress:**

*  He builds 180 meters in total, which means he's building 180 meters on day 3. 

**3.  Determine the amount built on day 1:**

*  Day 3 represents 140% of Day 1. 
*  We know he built 180 meters in total. 
*  This means he built 180/140 = 1.29 meters on Day 1 (approximately).

A car travels 160 miles at 40 mph and returns at 80 mph. What is the average speed?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Distance:** The car travels 160 miles andata and 160 miles back. Total distance = 160 + 160 = 320 miles.
2. **Time:** The trip takes time for each leg, so we need to find the total time.
    * First leg: 160 miles / 40 mph = 4 hours
    * Second leg: 160 miles / 80 mph = 2 hours
3. **Average Speed:** Average speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time: 320 miles / (4 + 2) hours = 320 / 6 = 53.33
