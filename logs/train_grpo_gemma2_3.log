**Step 1: Understand the Ratio** The ratio 7:3 means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 3 parts of flour.

**Step 2:  Find the Value of One Part** We know sugar is 14 cups, and the ratio is 7:3.  To find the value of one part, divide the total sugar by the ratio parts: 14 cups / 7 parts = 2 cups per part.

**Step 3: Calculate Flour** Since the ratio is 7:3, and each part represents 2 cups of sugar, we need to find flour for 2 cups of sugar.  Flour is 3 parts, so: 2 cups of sugar * 3 parts = 6 cups of flour.

   * We need to convert 2/3 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6:  (2/3) * (2/2) = 4/6
   * We don't need to convert 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 6, as it already has a denominator of 2.

2. **Add the fractions:** Now we have 4/6 + 1/2 
   * Add the numerators: 4 + 3 = 7 
   * Keep the denominator: 7/6

3. **Simplify (if possible):**  The fraction 7/6 cannot be simplified further.

3. **Subtract the lost volume:**  The tank then loses 85 liters. This reduction decreases the new volume. The final volume is now (X + 200) - 85 liters.

4. **Calculate the final change:**  The final change in the volume of the tank is **(X + 200) - 85** liters.


**Therefore, the final answer is 115.**

A tank gains 200 liters then loses 85. Compute final change.
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>


**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Start with the initial amount:** The tank begins with an unspecified amount of liquid. 
2. **Add the gain:** The tank gains 200 liters, so the total liquid is now 200 liters more than its starting amount.  
3. **Subtract the loss:** The tank loses 85 liters, meaning the final amount is 85 liters less than its current state.
4. **Calculate the final change:** The final change is the difference between the final amount and the initial amount.

A tank gains 200 liters then loses 85. Compute final change.
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Starting amount:** The problem states the tank gains 200 liters. This means the initial amount is 200 liters less than the final amount (since it's a gain).

2. **Loss:**  The tank loses 85 liters. We need to subtract this amount from the initial amount.

3. **Final change calculation:** 
    *  Final change = Initial amount - Final amount = 200 litres - 85 litres
    *  Final change = 115 litres

Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Initial state:** The tank starts with an unknown initial volume. We don't know that initial volume, so we'll call it "X".
2. **Gain:** The tank gains 200 liters. This means the tank's volume increases to X + 200.
3. **Loss:** The tank loses 85 liters. This means the final volume is (X + 200) - 85.
4. **Final change:** The final change in the tank's volume is the difference between the final volume and the initial volume.

Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>


**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Start with the initial amount:** The problem tells us the tank starts with a certain amount of liquid.  We don't know the initial amount, but this is the starting point.
2. **Add the gain:** We are told the tank gains 200 liters. This means the volume increases by 200 liters. 
3. **Subtract the loss:** The problem states the tank loses 85 liters. This amount is subtracted from the current volume. 
4. **Calculate the final change:** This is the final volume after both the gain and loss.  We find this by adding the gain and subtracting the loss.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate distance for the first part**

* Distance = Speed * Time 
* Distance = 62 km/h * 2 hours = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate distance for the second part**

* Speed = 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h
* Distance = Speed * Time = 124 km/h * 3 hours = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate total distance**

* Total distance = Distance in part 1 + Distance in part 2
* Total distance = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

**Answer:** The total distance traveled by the car is 496 km.

Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> 


**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Find the train's speed:** The train's speed is distance divided by time, so the speed is 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the slow down:** The return trip is 20% slower, meaning the train travels at 80% of its normal speed (100% - 20% = 80%).

3.  **Calculate the time for the return trip:**  We can use the formula time = distance / speed.  Since the distance is the same, we use the slowed speed to calculate the time: time = 120 miles / 0.8 = 150 minutes.

4. **Convert to hours:** Since there are 60 mins in an hour, the return trip takes 150 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2.5 hours.

   We can write this as an equation: (3/5)x = (4/5) * (x + 24)

3. **Solve the equation:** 
   *  Multiply both sides by 5: 3x = 4(x + 24)
   *  Expand: 3*x = 4x + 96
   *  Subtract 4x from both sides: x = 96

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate distance for the first part**

* Distance = Speed * Time 
* Distance = 62 km/h * 2 hours = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate distance for the second part**

* Speed = 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h
* Distance = Speed * Time = 124 km/h * 3 hours = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate total distance**

* Total distance = Distance in first part + Distance in second part
* Total distance = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

**Answer:** The total distance traveled by the car is 496 km.

A bicycle originally costs $200. It is discounted by 15% and then an additional $10 off. What is the final price?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate the first discount:** The bicycle is discounted by 15%, meaning it loses 0.15 of its original price. So, the discount amount is 0.15 * $200 = $30.  
   * The price after the discount is $200 - $30 = $170.

2. **Calculate the second discount:** An additional $10 is taken off the discounted price.  The final price is the price after the discount plus the second discount: $170 - $10 = $160.

**Final answer: 160**

A train travels 90 miles in 2 hours and then 60 miles in 1.5 hours. What is its average speed?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate speed for each segment:**
   * For the first segment: Speed = Distance / Time = 90 miles / 2 hours = 45 miles/hour
   * For the second segment: Speed = Distance / Time = 60 miles / 1.5 hours = 40 miles/hour 

2. **Calculate the total distance and total time:**
   * Total distance = 90 + 60 = 150 miles
   * Total time = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   * Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3.5 hours = 42.86 miles/hour (approximately)

A train travels 90 miles in 2 hours and then 60 miles in 1.5 hours. What is its average speed?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> 

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate speed for the first part:** The train's speed for the first part is distance divided by time: 90 miles / 2 hours = 45 miles per hour.
2. **Calculate speed for the second part:** The train's speed for the second part is distance divided by time: 60 miles / 1.5 hours = 40 miles per hour.
3. **Calculate the average speed:** Average speed is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken. The total distance is 90 + 60 = 150 miles. The total time taken is 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours. So the average speed is 150 miles / 3.5 hours = **42.86** miles per hour (approximately).

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate distance for the first part**

* Distance = Speed * Time 
* Distance = 62 * 2 = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate distance for the second part**

* Speed = 62 * 2 = 124 km/h
* Distance = Speed * Time = 124 * 3 = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate total distance**

* Total distance = Distance in first part + Distance in second part
* Total distance = 124 + 372 = 496 km

**Answer:** The total distance traveled by the car is **496 km**.

A library orders 200 books. 18 are damaged, and 25% of the remaining books are reserved. How many books are left for general checkout?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> 


**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Start with the initial amount:** The library began with 200 books.
2. **Calculate damaged books:** 18 books were damaged.
3. **Calculate remaining books:**  200 - 18 = 182 books remained.
4. **Calculate reserved books:** 25% of 182 is (0.25 * 182) = 45.5 books. 
5. **Calculate books remaining for checkout:**  182 - 45.5 = 136.5 books. 
6. **Adjust for rounding:** Since you can't have half a book, we'll assume that 136 books are left for general checkout.

**Final answer: 136**

Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>


**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Find the number of gummies:** The total number of candies is 120, and the numbers of chocolate and mints are 45 and 30 respectively. So, the number of gummies is 120-45-30 = 45 candies.
2. **Calculate the number of gummies remaining:** 20 candies were eaten from the total number of gummies, so the number of gummies remaining is 45-20 = 25.
3. **Calculate the number of remaining candies:**  The initial number of candies was 120, and there were 45 chocolates, 30 mints and 45 gummies.  So, the total number of candies is 120. However, 20 were eaten during the process, leaving us with 120-20= 100.

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Start with the initial number:** The train begins with 94 passengers.
2. **First stop changes:** 18 get off, leaving  94-18 = 76 passengers.  12 get on, bringing the total to 76 + 12 = 88 passengers.
3. **Second stop's impact:**  1/4 of the passengers leaving: (1/4) * 88 = 22 passengers get off. 
4. **Final count:** 88 - 22 = 66 passengers remain.

**Final answer: 66**

Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric>

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Start:** The train begins with 94 passengers.
2. **First Stop:**  18 leave, 12 join, so the number is 94 - 18 + 12 = 98
3. **Second Stop:** 1/4 of the passengers get off. (1/4) * 98 = 24.5 passengers leave.
4. **Final Passengers:** The train has 98-24.5 = 73.5 passengers. 
 
**Final answer: 73.5** 
 
**Important Note:** You cannot have half a passenger. This calculation should have been 73 passengers.

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate distance for the first part**

* Distance = Speed * Time = 62 * 2 = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate distance for the second part**

* Speed = 62 * 2 = 124 km/h
* Distance = Speed * Time = 124 * 3 = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate total distance**

* Total distance = Distance in first part + Distance in second part = 124 + 372 = 496 km

**Answer:** The total distance traveled by the car is 496 km.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate distance for the first part**

* Distance = Speed * Time = 62 * 2 = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate distance for the second part**

* Speed = 62 * 2 = 124 km/h
* Distance = Speed * Time = 124 * 3 = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate total distance**

* Total distance = 124 + 372 = **496 km** 

**Therefore, the total distance traveled by the car is 496 km.**

**Step-by-step solution:**

2. **Calculate cupcakes remaining after small boxes:** 240 - 90 = 150 cupcakes
3. **Calculate cupcakes in large boxes:** (1/4) * 150 = 37.5. Since we cannot have half a cupcake, we can assume there was a rounding error in the problem statement. Let's assume the baker intended to package 1/4 * 150 = 37.5. This would mean there were 37.5 cupcakes left in the remaining amount. 

* **Important Note:**  It's impossible to have a fraction of a cupcake, so there must be a mistake in the problem setup.

A taxi charges $6 base fare plus $2.50 per mile. If a ride costs $31, how many miles did the customer travel?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> miles. 

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Define variables:** Let 'm' represent the number of miles traveled.
2. **Write the equation:**  The total cost of the ride is the base fare plus the cost per mile: 6 + 2.5m = 31
3. **Solve for 'm':**

A store sells 500 toys. ¼ are sold Friday, 30% of the remainder Saturday. How many toys remain?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> 

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Friday sales:** The store sold 500 * (1/4)* = 125 toys on Friday.
2. **Remaining after Friday:**  The store had 500 - 125 = 375 toys left.
3. **Saturday sales:** 30% of the remaining toys sold on Saturday: 375 * 0.30 = 112.5.  Since we can't have half a toy, we'll assume they sold 112 toys on Saturday.
4. **Toys remaining:** The store had 375 - 112 = **263** toys remaining.

**Final answer: 263**

A store sells 500 toys. ¼ are sold Friday, 30% of the remainder Saturday. How many toys remain?
Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer: <numeric> 
**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Friday's sales:** The store sold (1/4) * 500 = 125 toys on Friday.
2. **Total after Friday:** Remaining toys: 500 - 125 = 375
3. **Saturday's sales:**  The store sold 0.30 * 375 = 112.5  toys on Saturday.  
4. **Toys remaining:**  Final remaining toys: 375 - 112.5 = 262.5
5. **Final answer:** Since we cannot have half a toy, there must be a mistake in the calculation. It is impossible for a store to sell portions of a toy. 


**Final answer:  Error in calculation**
