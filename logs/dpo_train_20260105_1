[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **First leg:** The car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km.

2. **Second leg:** The car travels twice the speed (62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h) for 3 hours, so the distance is 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km.

3. **Total distance:** The total distance is the sum of the distances from the first and second legs: 124 km + 372 km = 496 km.

**Final Answer:** 496 km

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

Let's break down the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at 62 km/h**

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h
Distance = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate the speed for the second part of the journey**

Speed = 62 km/h * 2
Speed = 124 km/h

**Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled at 124 km/h**

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h
Distance = 372 km

**Step 4: Calculate the total distance**

Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
Total Distance = 124 km + 372 km
Total Distance = 496 km

Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

Let's denote the speed of the car as $v$ and the distance traveled as $d$.

The distance traveled in the first part is $d_1 = v \cdot t_1 = 62 \cdot 2 = 124$ km.

The distance traveled in the second part is $d_2 = v \cdot t_2 = 2 \cdot 62 \cdot 3 = 372$ km.

The total distance is $d = d_1 + d_2 = 124 + 372 = \boxed{496}$ km.

Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

Let's denote the speed of the car as $v$ and the distance traveled as $d$.

The distance traveled in the first part is $d_1 = v \cdot t_1 = 62 \cdot 2 = 124$ km.

The distance traveled in the second part is $d_2 = v \cdot t_2 = 2 \cdot 62 \cdot 3 = 372$ km.

The total distance is $d = d_1 + d_2 = 124 + 372 = \boxed{496}$ km.

Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

Let's break down the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate distance traveled at 62 km/h**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate speed for the second part of the journey**

* Speed = 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h

**Step 3: Calculate distance traveled at 124 km/h**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**Step 4: Calculate total distance**

* Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
* Total Distance = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

**Answer:** 496 km

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

Let's break down the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate distance for the first part**

* Speed: 62 km/h
* Time: 2 hours
* Distance = Speed * Time = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate speed for the second part**

* Speed: 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h

**Step 3: Calculate distance for the second part**

* Speed: 124 km/h
* Time: 3 hours
* Distance = Speed * Time = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**Step 4: Calculate total distance**

* Total distance = Distance (part 1) + Distance (part 2) = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

**Answer:** 496 km

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **First leg:** The car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 62 * 2 = 124 km.

2. **Second leg:** The car travels twice the speed (62 * 2 = 124 km/h) for 3 hours, so the distance is 124 * 3 = 372 km.

3. **Total distance:** The total distance is 124 + 372 = 496 km.

**Answer:** 496

Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Solution:**

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - Speed: 62 km/h
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: Speed * Time = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - Speed: 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance: Speed * Time = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

3. **Total distance:**
   - Distance of first leg + Distance of second leg = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

### Solution:

Let's break down the problem into two parts:

**Part 1:**

* Speed: 62 km/h
* Time: 2 hours

* Distance = Speed * Time = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**Part 2:**

* Speed: 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h
* Time: 3 hours

* Distance = Speed * Time = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**Total Distance:**

* Total Distance = Distance (Part 1) + Distance (Part 2) = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

### Solution:

Let's break down the problem into two parts:

**Part 1:**

* Speed: 62 km/h
* Time: 2 hours

* Distance = Speed * Time = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**Part 2:**

* Speed: 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h
* Time: 3 hours

* Distance = Speed * Time = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**Total Distance:**

* Total Distance = Distance (Part 1) + Distance (Part 2) = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

### Solution

**1. Calculate distance traveled at 62 km/h:**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h 
* Distance = 124 km

**2. Calculate speed for the second part of the journey:**

* Speed = 62 km/h * 2
* Speed = 124 km/h

**3. Calculate distance traveled at 124 km/h:**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h
* Distance = 372 km

**4. Calculate total distance:**

* Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
* Total Distance = 124 km + 372 km
* Total Distance = 496 km

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Distance 1:** The car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 62 * 2 = 124 km.
2. **Speed 2:** The car travels twice the speed, so the speed is 62 * 2 = 124 km/h.
3. **Distance 2:** The car travels for 3 hours at 124 km/h, so the distance is 124 * 3 = 366 km.
4. **Total Distance:** The total distance is the sum of the distances from step 1 and step 2, so the total distance is 124 + 366 = 490 km.

**Answer:** 490

**Solution:**

1. **First leg:** The car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 62 * 2 = 124 km.

2. **Second leg:** The car travels at 62 * 2 = 124 km/h for 3 hours, so the distance is 124 * 3 = 372 km.

3. **Total distance:** The total distance is 124 + 372 = 596 km.

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Distance 1:** The car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 62 * 2 = 124 km.
2. **Speed 2:** The car travels twice the speed, so the speed is 62 * 2 = 124 km/h.
3. **Distance 2:** The car travels for 3 hours at 124 km/h, so the distance is 124 * 3 = 372 km.
4. **Total Distance:** The total distance is the sum of distance 1 and distance 2, which is 124 + 372 = 596 km.

**Answer:** 596

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Distance 1:** The car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 62 * 2 = 124 km.

2. **Speed 2:** The car travels twice the speed, so the speed is 62 * 2 = 124 km/h.

3. **Distance 2:** The car travels for 3 hours at 124 km/h, so the distance is 124 * 3 = 372 km.

4. **Total Distance:** The total distance is the sum of distance 1 and distance 2, so the total distance is 124 + 372 = 596 km.

**Answer:** 596

Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Distance for the first part:**
   - Distance = Speed x Time
   - Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

2. **Speed for the second part:**
   - Speed = 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h

3. **Distance for the second part:**
   - Distance = Speed x Time
   - Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

4. **Total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2
   - Total distance = 124 km + 372 km = 596 km

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Distance for the first part:** The car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 62 * 2 = 124 km.
2. **Speed for the second part:** The car travels twice its speed, so the speed is 62 * 2 = 124 km/h.
3. **Distance for the second part:** The car travels at 124 km/h for 3 hours, so the distance is 124 * 3 = 372 km.
4. **Total distance:** The total distance is the sum of the distances from both parts, so the total distance is 124 + 372 = 596 km.

**Answer:** 596

Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

## Solution:

**1. Calculate distance traveled at 62 km/h:**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**2. Calculate speed for the second part of the journey:**

* Speed = 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h

**3. Calculate distance traveled at 124 km/h for 3 hours:**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**4. Calculate total distance:**

* Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2 
* Total Distance = 124 km + 372 km = 596 km

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Instruction: Solve the math problem. You MUST output the full reasoning process followed by the final answer. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not stop until the answer is reached. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Distance 1:** The car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, so the distance is 62 * 2 = 124 km.
2. **Speed 2:** The car travels twice the speed (62 * 2 = 124 km/h) for 3 hours, so the distance is 124 * 3 = 372 km.
3. **Total Distance:** The total distance is the sum of the distances from step 1 and step 2, so the total distance is 124 + 372 = 596 km.

**Answer:** 596
