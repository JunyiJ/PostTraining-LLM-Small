Sansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size. She sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. If she sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day, how many does she earns every 3 days? Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer.
195


**Here's how we can figure out Sansa's earnings:**

**1. Calculate the price of a 16-inch portrait:**

   - Sansa sells a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of an 8-inch portrait.
   - Twice the price of an 8-inch portrait is $5 * 2 = $10

**2. Calculate earnings from 8-inch portraits:**

   - Sansa sells three 8-inch portraits at a price of $5 each.
   - Earnings from 8-inch portraits: 3 * $5 = $15

**3. Calculate earnings from 16-inch portraits:**

   - Sansa sells five 16-inch portraits at a price of $10 each.
   - Earnings from 16-inch portraits: 5 * $10 = $50

**4. Calculate total daily earnings:**

   - Total daily earnings: $15 + $50 = $65

**5. Calculate total earnings over 3 days:**

   - Total earnings over 3 days: $65 * 3 = $195


**Final answer:**  Sansa earns $195 every 3 days.

Archibald eats 1 apple a day for two weeks. Over the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks. Over the next two weeks, he eats 3 apples a day. Over these 7 weeks, how many apples does he average a week? Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer.
10
 
 
***
Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Week 1 & 2:**

* Archibald eats 1 apple/day * 7 days = 7 apples
* Total apples eaten in the first two weeks: 7 apples

**Week 3:**

* Archibald eats the same number of apples as the first two weeks, so he eats 7 apples.

**Week 4 & 5:**

* Archibald eats 3 apples/day * 7 days = 21 apples

**Total Apples Eaten:**

* Total apples eaten across 7 weeks: 7 + 7 + 21 = 35 apples 

**Average Apples Per Week:**

* Average apples per week: 35 apples / 7 weeks = 5 apples/week


 **Final Answer: Archibald averages 5 apples per week.**

Wickham is throwing a huge Christmas party. He invites 30 people. Everyone attends the party, and half of the guests bring a plus one (one other person). He plans to serve a 3-course meal for the guests. If he uses a new plate for every course, how many plates does he need in total for his guests? Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer.
135
 


Let's break this down:

1. **Guests:** Wickham has 30 guests.
2. **Plus ones:** Half of his guests bring a plus one, so 30 / 2 = 15 guests have a plus one.
3. **Total guests with plus ones:** 30 + 15 = 45 guests in total. 
4. **Courses:** He's serving a three-course meal, so he'll need plates for each course. 


**Final answer:** 45 guests x 3 courses = 135 plates 

Answer: 135 plates.

There are some lions in Londolozi at first. Lion cubs are born at the rate of 5 per month and lions die at the rate of 1 per month. If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first? Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer.
100



Answer: 148 lions, and 153 lions were born
Final answer: 153 lions were born 


 
 
Final Answer: 


* We start with the present population. 148 lions
* Over a year, 5 cubs are born per month.
* Let's figure out the total for a whole year = 5 lions/month x 12 months = 60 cubs
 
*To figure out how many lions were born. Since we don't have starting numbers, we can figure it out by taking the number of cubs and adding the lions who died over the year.
 
* Total cubs: 60
* Total lions: 60. 

**It is impossible to determine how many lions were born without knowing how many lions died.

John volunteers at a shelter twice a month for 3 hours at a time.  How many hours does he volunteer per year? Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer.
72
 


**Step 1: Hours per month**

* John volunteers twice a month, so he volunteers 2 hours per visit. 
 
**Step 2: Hours per year**

* He volunteers for 3 hours per visit and volunteers 2 times a month, therefore he volunteers for 2 * 3 = 6 hours per month. 
* He volunteers for 6 hours per month, so he volunteers for 6 hours/month * 12 months/year = 72 hours per year.

**Final answer:** John volunteers for 72 hours per year.

    * Third ticket: $2 + $1 = $3
    * Fourth ticket: $3 + $1 = $4
    * Fifth ticket: $4 + $1 = $5

* **Calculate the profit:**
    * Total profit: $1 + $2 + $3 + $4 + $5 = $15

* **Calculate the cost of the tickets:**
    * Total cost of the tickets: $15 - $4 = $11

* **Calculate the total prize money:**
    * $11 is spent on the tickets. 
    * $11 is the cost. 
    * $11 is the cost. 
    * $0.00 is donated as a donation

* **Calculate the profit:**
    * $15 is the profit. 

* **Calculate the number of prizes earned:**
    * Total prizes: $15.00 - $4.00 = $11.00


**Final answer:** The winner will receive $11.00.

Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer.
2
 


Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the total number of students:**

* 18 students were assigned.

**2. Find the number of students that are girls:**

* 18 students - 8 boys = 10 girls

**3. Find the number of students who were girls:**

* 10 girls

**4. Calculate the number of girls unable to join:**

* If the number of girls and boys is the same, then the number of girls who couldn't join is the number of girls less than 8 boys and that way the total number of the girls that could join is the number of the total students minus the total girls that couldn't join


* 8 boys - 10 girls = 2 students 

 **Final answer:** 2 girls were not able to join the field trip.

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. Please reason step-by-step,  then give: Final answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate distance traveled at 62 km/h:**
   * Distance = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

2. **Calculate speed at which the car traveled for the second part:**
   * The car traveled twice its speed at 62 km/h, so the speed is 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h

3. **Calculate distance traveled at 124 km/h:**
   * Distance = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

4. **Calculate total distance:**
   * Total distance = Distance at 62 km/h + Distance at 124 km/h
   * Total distance = 124 km + 372 km = 596 km

**Final answer:** 596 km
