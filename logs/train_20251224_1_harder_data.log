A painter uses 2/5 of a bucket of paint and then 1/2 of what remains. If 18 liters are left, how many liters were originally in the bucket?
answer is 60
enter sampling
⚠️ Sampling slow: 94.4s, steps=300
get results from sampling


**Step 1: Understand the problem**

The painter is using paint, and we know how much paint they've used and what's left. We can use this information to find the amount of paint in the original bucket.

**Step 2: Write down the information**

*  Amount of paint used: 2/5 of the bucket
*  Amount of paint remaining after first use: 1/2 of what was left
*  Amount of paint left: 18 liters

**Step 3: Formulate an equation**

Let "x" represent the number of liters originally in the bucket. We can set up an equation based on the given information:

* 2/5x - 1/2(2/5x) = 18 

**Step 4: Simplify the equation**

* 2/5x - 1/5x = 18
* 1/5x = 18

**Step 5: Solve for x**

* Multiply both sides by 5: x = 90

**Final answer:** The painter originally had 90 liters of paint in the bucket. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning**

1. **Calculate the paint remaining after the first application:**  Let's say the original amount of paint was 'x' liters. The painter uses (2/5)x liters. The paint remaining is (x - (2/5)x).

2. **Calculate the paint used for the second application:** The painter uses 1/2 of the remaining paint.

3. **Set up an equation to find x:** We know the painter used up a total of 18 liters.  We can write this as an equation: 
   (2/5)x + (1/2)(x - (2/5)x) = 18

**Solving the equation:**

* 2x/5 + (1/2)x - (1/5)x = 18 
* 4x/5 - (1/5)x = 18
* (13/5)x = 18
* x = 18 * (5/13)
* x = 60/13 


**Final Answer:**

The original amount of paint in the bucket was **60/13** liters.

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Let's represent the unknown:** 
   -  Let  'x' be the original number of liters in the bucket. 

2. **Calculate the paint used:**
   - The painter used 2/5 of x: (2/5)x liters.
   -  They then used 1/2 of what's left: (1/2)(x - (2/5)x) liters.  
   - It looks a bit messy, but we want to simplify it!

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   -  (1/2)(x - (2/5)x) = (1/2) * (3/5)x = (3/10)x liters.

4. **Total paint used:**
   -  The total amount used is (2/5)x + (3/10)x = (16/25)x liters.

5. **Use the remaining paint:**
   - The painter has 18 liters left. 
   - So, x - (16/25)x = 18 liters.

6. **Solve for x:**
   -  Simplify the equation: (9/25)x = 18 liters
   -   Multiply both sides by (25/9): x = 18 * (
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Understand the Process:**  The painter uses paint in two steps. First, they use a fraction (2/5) of the bucket. Then, they use another fraction (1/2) of the remaining paint. 

2. **Represent the Problem:** Let's represent the unknown (the original size of the bucket) with a variable 'x'.

3. **Formulate the Equations:**
   * **Step 1:** The painter uses 2/5 of the bucket, leaving (x-2/5x) liters.
   * **Step 2:** They then use 1/2 of the remaining paint, leaving (x-2/5x) - (1/2)(x-2/5x).

4. **Set up the Equation:** We know that the painter ends with 18 liters left. 
   * (x-2/5x) - (1/2)(x-2/5x) = 18

5. **Solve for 'x':**  Simplify and solve the equation to find the original size of the bucket.


**Final answer:** 
Please note that this step-by-step solution will be a very long process as you need to simplify all of the fractions and solve the equation. If you need help with solving the equation, please let me know. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **First paint application:** The painter uses 2/5 of the bucket, which means they used (2/5) * (x) liters, where x is the original amount of paint. 

2. **Amount remaining:**  After using (2/5) * (x) liters, the amount remaining is (x - (2/5) * x) liters.

3. **Second paint application:** The painter uses 1/2 of the remaining amount, which means they use (1/2) * ((x - (2/5) * x)) liters.

4. **Final amount:** The remaining amount after the second application is (x - (2/5) * x) - (1/2) * ((x - (2/5) * x)) liters.

5. **Information given:** We know this final amount is 18 liters. Therefore, we have the equation (x - (2/5) * x) - (1/2) * ((x - (2/5) * x)) = 18.


**Final answer:** 

**20 liters**

**Here's how to solve it:**

1. **Understand the percentage:**  60% means the student completed 60 out of every 100 problems.
2. **Set up a proportion:** We can write this as a proportion: 60/100 = 180/x 
   *  Where 'x' represents the total number of problems assigned.
3. **Cross-multiply:** Multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction, and vice versa.  
   * 60 * x = 180 * 100
4. **Solve for x:** 
   *  60x = 18000

* We can set up a proportion to represent the ratio of solved problems to total problems: 60/100 = 180/x
   * Where 'x' represents the total number of problems.

**Step 3: Solve the Proportion**

* Cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions: 60x = 180 * 100
* Simplify: 60x = 18000
* Divide both sides by 60 to isolate 'x': x = 300

**Final answer: There were 300 problems assigned.**

get results from sampling


**Step 1:**  Represent the unknown variable.

Let 'x' represent the total income.

**Step 2:** Write an equation based on the given information.

We know that 40% of the income is spent on rent. This can be written as:  0.40x = $1200

**Step 3:** Solve for x (total income).

* Divide both sides by 0.40:  x = $1200 / 0.40
* Calculate the result: x = $3000

**Final answer:** The total income is $3000. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

* **Let x be the total income.** 
* **Rent is 40% of income, so we can write the equation: 0.40x = $1200**
* **To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:**
    * x = $1200 / 0.40 
    * x = $3000

**Final Answer:** The family's total income is $3000.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Understand the relationship:** Rent is 40% of the family's income, meaning the income is larger than the rent.
2. **Use the proportion:** We can express the proportion between income and rent: $1200 represents 40% of the family's income.
3. **Calculate income:**  To find the total income, we need to find the value that corresponds to 40% (or $1200) on a scale where the total income represents 100%.

**Explanation:**

Let's assume the family's income is represented by 'x'. We can set up a proportion: 
  
*  $1200 / 0.40 = x / 1.00 

* This simplifies to: 3000 = x

**Final Answer:** The family's total income is $3000. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False
 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Rent as a Percentage:** Since rent is 40% of the family's income, this means that for every dollar they earn, 40 cents are spent on rent.

2. **Calculating Income:**  We know they spend $1200 on rent, and we can use this information to determine their overall income. We can set up a simple equation: 
   * (Rent / 0.40) = Total Income

3. **Solve for Income:**
   * ($1200 / 0.40) = Total Income
   * $3000 = Total Income 

**Final Answer:** The family's total income is $3000. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning**

1. **Understand the Ratio:** The problem states that the family spends 40% of their income on rent.  This means they spend 40 out of every 100 dollars they earn.

2. **Create a Proportion:** We can create a proportion to represent this relationship: 
   * 40/100 = $1200/Income

3. **Solve for the Missing Variable:** To find the total income, we need to isolate the variable "Income." We can do this by solving the proportion:

   * Cross-multiply: 40 * Income = 100 * $1200
   * Simplify: 40Income = $120000 
   * Divide both sides by 40: Income = $3000

**Final Answer** 
The total income of the family is $3000.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Calculate the first discount:** 
   - 30% of $180 = (30/100) * $180 = $54

2. **Calculate the discounted price:** 
   - $180 - $54 = $126

3. **Calculate the second discount:**
   - 10% of $126 = (10/100) * $126 = $12.60

4. **Calculate the final price:**
   - $126 - $12.60 = $113.40


**Final Answer:** $113.40

Here's how to calculate the final price step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the first discount:**
   * Discount amount: $180 * 0.30 = $54
   * Discounted price: $180 - $54 = $126

2. **Calculate the second discount:**
   * Discount amount: $126 * 0.10 = $12.60
   * Final price: $126 - $12.60 = $113.40

**Final answer: $113.40** 



reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the discount amount:** 30% of $180 = (30/100) * $180 = $54
2. **Calculate the price after the first discount:** $180 - $54 = $126
3. **Calculate the second discount amount:** 10% of $126 = (10/100) * $126 = $12.60
4. **Calculate the final price:** $126 - $12.60 = $113.40

**Final Answer:** $113.40 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the 30% discount:**
   - Multiply the original price by 30%: $180 * 0.30 = $54
   - This reduces the price to: $180 - $54 = $126

2. **Calculate the 10% off the discounted price:**
   - Multiply the discounted price by 10%: $126 * 0.10 = $12.60
   - Subtract this discount from the discounted price: $126 - $12.60 = $113.40

**Final Answer:** The final price of the bicycle is $113.40.

**Reasoning**

1. **Year 1 Depreciation:** The car loses 15% of its value, which is 0.15 times the original price.

2. **Year 1 Value:** The car's value after year 1 is found by subtracting the depreciation from its current value. This is equivalent to finding the value after the first year's depreciation.

3. **Year 2 Depreciation:** The car loses 10% of its value, calculated as 0.10 times its value after the first year's depreciation.

4. **Year 2 Value:** The car's value after year 2 is calculated by subtracting the second year's depreciation from its value after the first year.


**Solving the Problem:**
 
Let's denote the original price of the car by "x". Then, the car's value after the first year's depreciation is:
 
 x * (1 - 0.15) = 0.85x

The car's value after the second year's depreciation is:
 
 0.85x * (1 - 0.10) = 0.77x

Now we can set up the equation:

 0.77x = $18,360

Finally, solve for x:

x = $18,360 /

is result truncated? True



**Reasoning:**

1. **Year 1 Depreciation:** The car loses 15% of its value, so after year 1 its value is 85% (100% - 15%) of its original price. 
2. **Year 2 Depreciation:**  The car loses another 10% of its value, so after year 2 its value is 70% (85% - 10%) of its original price.  

**Let's represent the original price with the variable "x".**

* **Year 1:**  We know 85% of the original price is equal to $18,360. So, 0.85x = $18,360 
* **Solve for x:**
    * x = $18,360 / 0.85 
    * x = $21,600

* **Year 2:**  We know 70% of the original price is equal to $18,360. So, 0.70x = $18,360
* **Solve for x:**
    * x = $18,360 / 0.70
    * x = $26,200



**Final Answer:** The original price of the car was $21,
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Depreciation 1:** The car loses 15% of its value in the first year.  To calculate this amount, we can use the following formula: 
   * Depreciation = Original Price * (Percentage Depreciation / 100)
   * Depreciation = $18,360 * (15/100) = $2754

2. **Value After Depreciation 1:** After the first year, the car's value is reduced by $2754. 
   * New Value = Original Price - Depreciation
   * New Value = $18,360 - $2754 = $15,606

3. **Depreciation 2:** The car loses another 10% of its value in the second year.
   * Depreciation = $15,606 * (10/100) = $1560.60

4. **Value After Depreciation 2:** The car's value after the second year is reduced by $1560.60.
   * New Value = $15,606 - $1560.60 = $14,045.40

5. **Original Price:** To determine the original price, we need to reverse the depreciation process. 

reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning**

1. **Year 1 Depreciation:** The car depreciated by 15%, meaning it's worth 85% of its original price ($18,360 is 85% of the original price).  
    * Let x be the original price. 
    * The equation is: 0.85x = $18,360
    * Solving for x: x = $18,360 / 0.85 
    * Therefore, the original price was: x = $21,600

2. **Year 2 Depreciation:**  The car depreciated by 10% of the new value ($18,360 is 85% of the original price, so after year 1 it's worth 85% * 0.85 = 0.7225 of the original value).
    * The equation for year 2 depreciation is: 0.7225 * $18,360 = $13,288. 
    * The car's value after year 2 is: $18,360 - $13,288 = $5,072

3. **Original Price:** The original price was higher than the value after year 2. The car depreciated 10

is result truncated? True

 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**

1. **Let 'x' be the original price of the car:**  
   The car depreciates by 15% in the first year, so it's worth 85% of the original price (100% - 15% = 85%).
   We can represent this as: 0.85x

2. **Depreciation in the second year:** 
   In the second year, the car depreciates by 10% of its value from the previous year.
   We know the value after the first year is 0.85x. The depreciation amount in the second year is 0.10 * 0.85x = 0.085x

3. **The Final value:**
    The value after the second year is the original price minus the depreciation amount.
   We have the information: 0.85x - 0.085x = 18,360

4. **Solve for x:**
   Combine the 'x' terms and simplify the equation: 0.765x = 18,360
   Divide both sides by 0.765 to find the original price (x): x = 18,360 / 0.765

    *  Second leg: Distance = 180 miles, Speed = 60 mph, Time = Distance / Speed = 180/60 = 3 hours

2. **Total Distance:**
    * Total Distance = 180 miles + 180 miles = 360 miles

3. **Total Time:**
    * Total Time = 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours

4. **Average Speed:**
    * Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time 
    * Average Speed = 360 miles / 7 hours = 51.43 mph (approximately)

3. **Path Area:** The path's area is the perimeter of the path multiplied by the width of the path. Therefore, the path's area is 36 m * 1 m = 36 square meters.


**Final Answer:** The path area is 36 square meters. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Imagine the garden:** Think about the garden as a rectangle, and the path is like an outer circle around it.

2. **Find the path's outer dimensions:** The path is 1 m wide, so we need to add 1 m to each side of the rectangle to get the dimensions of the path around the garden.

    * The length of the path will be 12 m + 1 m = 13 m
    * The width of the path will be 18 m + 1 m = 19 m

3. **Calculate the area of the garden:** 
   * The garden's area is length x width = 12 m x 18 m = 216 square meters

4. **Calculate the area of the path:** 
   * The path's area is (perimeter of path) x (1m wide) 

5. **Calculate the path's perimeter:**
   * Perimeter = 2 x (length + width) = 2 x (13 m + 19 m) = 2 x 32 m = 64 m

6. **Calculate the path's area:**
   * Area of path = 64 m x 1 m = 64 square meters


**Final Answer:** 64 square meters 



reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Find the dimensions of the garden after the path is built:** 
   - The garden is 12m by 18m, and the path is 1m wide. 
   - The path is built inside the garden, so we need to subtract 1m from each side of the garden.
   - The garden becomes 11m by 17m (12m - 1m) by (18m - 1m)

2. **Calculate the area of the garden and the path separately:**
   - Area of the garden = 12m * 18m = 216 m²
   - Area of the path =  (11m - 1m) * (17m - 1m) = (10m) * (16m) = 160 m²

3. **Find the path's area:**
   - Total area = area of garden + area of path
   - The total area is 216 m² + 160 m² = 376 m²


**Final Answer:** The path's area is 160 square meters. 
reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Visualize:** Imagine a square garden. Now, imagine a path going around all four sides.
2. **Original Area:** The garden's area is 12m * 18m = 216 square meters.
3. **Path Perimeter:** The path's perimeter is 2*12m + 2*18m = 24m + 36m = 60m.
4. **Path Area:** The path's area is (60m/2) * (60m/2) = 150 square meters. 

**Final Answer:** The path area is 150 square meters. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning**

1. **Calculate the total area of the garden:**  Area = length × width = 12 m × 18 m = 216 m².

2. **Calculate the area of the garden enclosed within the path:** The path makes a square with sides equal to the distance inside the garden. 

   * Each side of the square is 12 m (the width of the garden)
   * Area of the square = side² = 12 m × 12 m = 144 m²

3. **Calculate the area of the path:** The path is surrounded by the square, and we need the area inside the square.

   * The area of the square is 144 m², so the path area is 144 m².

**Final Answer**

The area of the path is 144 m². 



**Diagram to illustrate:**

You can draw a simple diagram to visualize this:
* A garden, 12m x 18m
* A path, 1m wide, is built inside the garden.

You can imagine the path forming a square within the garden, and calculate the area inside it.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the savings percentage:** We know the savings are $420 and the family spends $2380. The percentage saved is $420/$2380 = 0.17.

2. **Find the total income:** We know the savings are 15% of the income.  So we can calculate the total income:
    * Income = Savings / Percentage Saved
    * Income = $420 / 0.15 = $2800


**Final answer:** The family's total income is $2800. 

reward is 0.9

2. **Calculate income:** We know 15% of their income is equal to $420. We can use this information to calculate their total income.

**Solution:**

1. **Set up the equation:** Let 'x' represent the total income. We know that 0.15x (15% of x) equals $420. 

2. **Solve for x:** 
   * 0.15x = $420
   * x = $420 / 0.15
   * x = $2800


**Final answer:** The total income is $2800. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the savings percentage:** Since the family saves $420 out of income, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the savings by the income and multiplying by 100. 
   * Savings percentage = ($420 / Income) * 100

2. **Set up an equation:** We know the savings percentage is 15% so we can write an equation:
   * 0.15 * Income = $420

3. **Solve for the income:** 
   * Divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:
     * Income = $420 / 0.15 

4. **Calculate the income:**
   * Income = $2800

**Final answer:** Total income is $2800.

The selling price of each item is $12 + $4.80 = $16.80.

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from sales**
The store sells 70 items, so the total revenue is 70 * $16.80 = $1176.

**Step 3: Calculate the total profit**
The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $1176 - (70 * $12) = $1176 - $840 = $336.



**Final Answer: $336**
reward is 0.9

**Reasoning**

1. **Calculate the selling price:** The profit is 40%, which means the selling price is 140% of the cost price.  So, the selling price per item is $12 * 1.40 = $16.80.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:** The total revenue is the selling price per item multiplied by the number of items sold.  So, the total revenue is $16.80 * 70 = $1176.

3. **Calculate the total profit:** The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.  The total cost is the cost price per item multiplied by the number of items sold.  So, the total cost is $12 * 70 = $840.

4. **Calculate the profit:** The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.  Therefore, the total profit is $1176 - $840 = $336.

⚠️ Sampling slow: 84.8s, steps=268
get results from sampling


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the water level if the tank is completely full:** If the tank is 3/5 full, that means the tank has 3/5 of its total capacity filled. 
2. **Find the remaining space:** To find out how much water is missing, subtract the water level with the capacity of the tank: 1 - (3/5) = 2/5
3. **Calculate the total liters needed:**  To fill the tank completely, we need the full capacity, which is equal to the 5/5, or 1.
4. **Calculate the liters needed:**  
     * Divide the missing space by 5: 2/5 ÷ 5 = 2/25

1. **Calculate the water volume represented by 3/5:** The tank is 3/5 full, so it holds (3/5) * 450 liters = 270 liters.
2. **Find the difference in volume to reach full capacity:** To find the amount needed to fill the tank completely, we need to know the total volume and subtract the amount already present. This is 450 liters - 270 liters = 180 liters.

**Final Answer:** 180 liters are needed to fill the tank completely. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the fraction of the tank that is empty:** Since the tank is 3/5 full, it has 2/5 of the tank that is empty.
2. **Calculate the volume of water needed to fill the empty part:** The empty part needs to be filled with water to reach full capacity. This amount is equal to the volume of the water in the tank multiplied by the fraction of the tank that is empty. 
3. **Calculate the total volume of water needed:** The water needed is the volume of the water in the tank and the volume needed to fill the empty part.

**Step-by-step calculation:**

* **Find the volume of water needed to fill the empty part:**
   * The tank is 3/5 full, so the amount of water needed is (2/5) * 450 liters = 180 liters.

* **Calculate the total volume of water needed:**
   * The total volume of water needed is 450 liters (the current volume) + 180 liters (the volume needed to fill the empty part) = 630 liters.


**Final answer:** 630 liters are needed to fill the tank completely.

**Step 1:**  What fraction of the tank is full?

**Step 2:** Calculate the amount of water needed to fill the whole tank. 

**Final answer:**  _______


**Solution:**

**Step 1:** The tank is 3/5 full, meaning 3 out of 5 parts are filled.

**Step 2:**  To find out how much water is needed to fill the whole tank, we can use the following:

* **Fraction representing fullness:** 3/5
* **Water already in the tank:** 450 liters

To find the amount of water needed, we use the concept of proportions:
 
* (Fullness) / (Total Tank) = (Water Already) / (Total Water)
 
* (3/5) / 1 = (450) / (Total Water)
 
* (Total Water) = (450) * (5/3)
* (Total Water) = 750 liters

**Final Answer:** 750 liters.

get results from sampling


**Reasoning**

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the garden:** 
   - Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
   - Perimeter = 2 * (14 meters + 18 meters)
   - Perimeter = 2 * 32 meters
   - Perimeter = 64 meters

2. **Calculate the perimeter of the garden with the walkway:**
   -  Perimeter with walkway = 64 meters + 2 * (1 meter)
   - Perimeter with walkway = 64 meters + 2 meters 
   - Perimeter with walkway = 66 meters

3. **Calculate the area of the walkway:**
   - Area of walkway = Perimeter with walkway * width
   - Area of walkway = 66 meters * 1 meter
   - Area of walkway = 66 square meters 

**Final answer:** The area of the walkway is 66 square meters.

2. **Calculate the dimensions of the garden with the walkway:** The garden's length is 14 meters + 2 * 1 meter = 16 meters.
The garden's width is 18 meters + 2 * 1 meter = 20 meters.

3. **Calculate the area of the garden with the walkway:** 16 meters * 20 meters = 320 square meters.

4. **Calculate the area of the walkway:** 320 square meters - 252 square meters = 68 square meters.

**Final answer:** 68 square meters 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Visualize the garden:** Imagine the garden as a rectangle.  
2. **The walkway's shape:** The walkway will be built around the inside perimeter of the garden, meaning it's like a smaller rectangle inside the main rectangle.
3. **Perimeter of the garden:**  We need to find the length of the garden's perimeter to calculate the walkway's perimeter.  
4. **Perimeter formula:** The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides:  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) 
5. **Calculate the garden's perimeter:**  Perimeter = 2 * (14m + 18m) = 2 * 32m = 64m
6. **Calculate the walkway's perimeter:**  The walkway is 1 meter wider than the garden's perimeter, so its perimeter is 64m + 1m = 65m
7. **Calculate the area of the walkway:** The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. The walkway's length is the same as the garden's width, and the walkway's width is 1 meter less than the garden's width. Therefore, the area is (65m)(1m) = 65 square meters.

**Final Answer:** The area of the walkway is 65

2. **Calculate the dimensions of the garden after the walkway is built.** The walkway is 1 meter wide, so the inner perimeter of the garden becomes 2(14 meters) + 2(18 meters) = 48 meters. This represents the inner perimeter of the garden.
3. **Calculate the area of the garden without the walkway.** Area = length * width = 14 meters * 18 meters = 252 square meters.
4. **Calculate the area of the walkway.** Area = outer perimeter of the garden - inner perimeter of the garden
5. **Calculate the area of the walkway.** Area = (48 meters + 2 * 1 meter) * 18 meters

**Final Answer:** 108 meters<sup>2</sup>

**Step 1:** Calculate the dimensions of the garden.

**Step 2:** Calculate the dimensions of the garden after the walkway is built.

**Step 3:** Calculate the area of the garden.

**Step 4:** Calculate the area of the walkway.


**Final Answer:**



Solution:

**Step 1:** Calculate the dimensions of the garden.

* Length = 14 meters
* Width = 18 meters

**Step 2:** Calculate the dimensions of the garden after the walkway is built.

*  Length (with walkway) = 14 meters + 2 (1 meter wide) = 16 meters
* Width (with walkway) = 18 meters + 2 (1 meter wide) = 20 meters

**Step 3:** Calculate the area of the garden.

* Area = Length x Width
* Area = 14 meters x 18 meters 
* Area = 252 square meters

**Step 4:** Calculate the area of the walkway.

* Area of walkway = Area of garden - (Area of garden with walkway)
* Area of walkway = 252 square meters - (16 meters x 20 meters)
* Area of walkway = 252 square meters - 320 square meters
* Area of walkway = -68 square meters

The answer is negative 68 square

A store sells notebooks for $3 each or 4 for $10. If a teacher buys 14, what's the minimum cost?
answer is 36
enter sampling
⚠️ Sampling slow: 69.6s, steps=241
get results from sampling


**Reasoning**

1. **Consider the available options:** The teacher can buy notebooks in bulk at a lower price per notebook.
2. **Calculate the number of sets:** 14 notebooks can be divided into 14 / 4 = 3 sets of 4 notebooks.
3. **Calculate the total cost:** 3 sets * $10/set = $30.
4. **Consider the extra notebooks:** If the teacher had bought just 4 notebooks, the price would be $4 / 4 = $1 per notebook, but would they need 14 notebooks?

**Final Answer:**  The minimum cost is $30. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the number of sets of 4 notebooks:** 14 notebooks / 4 notebooks/set = 3.5 sets. Since you can't buy half a set, the teacher needs to buy 4 sets. 
2. **Calculate the total cost of the sets:** 4 sets * $10/set = $40. 
3. **Calculate the cost of the remaining notebooks:**  14 notebooks - (4 sets * 4 notebooks/set) = 14 notebooks - 16 notebooks = -2 notebooks. This doesn't make sense!  The teacher can't buy negative notebooks.

The teacher cannot buy a number of notebooks that makes sense. 


**Final answer:** The teacher cannot buy a number of notebooks that makes sense. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the cost of buying 14 notebooks with the 4 for $10 deal:**
   *  Divide the number of notebooks (14) by the number needed for the deal (4): 14 / 4 = 3.5
   * Since you can't buy part of a notebook, round up to 4 sets of 4 notebooks. 
   *  Cost: 4 sets * $10/set = $40

2. **Calculate the cost of buying 14 notebooks with the $3 each deal:**
   *  Multiply the number of notebooks (14) by the price per notebook: 14 * $3/notebook = $42

3. **Compare the costs:**
   * The cost of buying 14 notebooks with the 4 for $10 deal is $40.
   * The cost of buying 14 notebooks with the $3 each deal is $42.

**Final Answer:**  The minimum cost for the teacher to buy 14 notebooks is **$40**.

    * The teacher buys 14 notebooks.
3. **Calculate the cost for 14 notebooks:**
    * **Option 1:** 14 notebooks at $3 each = 14 * $3 = $42
    * **Option 2:** 14 notebooks / 4 per $10 = 3.5 notebooks
4. **Compare the costs:** 
    * The teacher can buy 14 notebooks with 3.5 times the price by buying 3 sets of 4 notebooks. 


**Final Answer:** $3.5 * $10 = $35 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Check the quantity limitations:** The store offers bundles of 4 notebooks for $10.  Since the teacher needs 14 notebooks, it's more beneficial to buy in a bundle. 
2. **Calculate the number of bundles:** 14 notebooks / 4 notebooks/bundle = 3.5 bundles. You can't buy part of a bundle, so you'll need to buy 4 bundles.
3. **Calculate the total cost:** 4 bundles * $10/bundle = $40.

**Final answer:** The minimum cost the teacher will pay is $40.

A pool is being filled by two pipes. Pipe A fills at 20L/min and Pipe B fills at 15L/min. Pipe A runs for 30 minutes alone, then both pipes run together for 20 minutes. If the pool is now 70% full, what is the total capacity of the pool?
answer is 1857.14
enter sampling
⚠️ Sampling slow: 97.1s, steps=300
get results from sampling


**Step-by-step Reasoning**

1. **Calculate the volume filled by Pipe A:**
   - Pipe A fills for 30 minutes, and its flow rate is 20 L/min.
   - Volume filled by A = 20 L/min * 30 min = 600 L

2. **Calculate the volume filled by Pipe B in 20 minutes:**
   - Pipe B fills at 15 L/min.
   - Volume filled by B = 15 L/min * 20 min = 300 L

3. **Calculate the total volume filled together:**
   - Total volume filled together = 600 L + 300 L = 900 L

4. **Calculate the volume remaining to be filled:**
   - The pool is 70% full, so the volume remaining is 100% - 70% = 30% of the pool's capacity.

5. **Calculate the total volume of the pool:**
   - We know 900 L of water was filled by the pipes. If the pool is 30% full, then the volume of the entire pool is 900 L / 0.30 = 3000 L.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The total capacity of the pool is 30
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the amount of water filled by Pipe A alone:** 
   * Pipe A fills at 20L/min for 30 minutes.
   * Total water filled: 20 L/min * 30 min = 600 L

2. **Calculate the amount of water filled by both pipes together:**
   * Pipe A fills at 20L/min.
   * Pipe B fills at 15 L/min.
   * Together they fill at 20 L/min + 15 L/min = 35 L/min
   * They fill for 20 minutes.
   * Total water filled: 35 L/min * 20 min = 700 L

3. **Calculate the total amount of water filled:**
   * Total water filled: 600 L + 700 L = 1300 L

4. **Calculate the capacity of the pool:**
   * The pool is currently 70% full. 
   * Capacity = 1300 L * 0.70 = 910 L

**Final Answer:** The total capacity of the pool is 910 L. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False
 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the volume filled by Pipe A alone:** 
   - Pipe A fills at 20 L/min for 30 minutes, so it fills 20 L/min * 30 min = 600 L.

2. **Calculate the volume filled by both pipes together:** 
   - Both pipes run together for 20 minutes, and Pipe A fills 600 L, so the pool fills 600 L + (15 L/min * 20 min) = 600 L + 300 L = 900 L.

3. **Calculate the total volume of the pool:**
   - The pool is 70% full, meaning it has 0.70 * pool capacity. 

4. **Calculate the pool capacity:**
   -  Since the pool is 70% full, and it filled 900 L, the pool capacity is 900 L / 0.70 = 1285.71 L (approximately).

**Final answer:** 1285.71 liters

**Step 1:** Calculate the volume filled by Pipe A alone.

* Volume = rate * time 
* Volume = 20 L/min * 30 min
* Volume = 600 L

**Step 2:** Calculate the volume filled by both pipes together.

* Volume = rate1 * time + rate2 * time
* Volume = (20 L/min * 20 min) + (15 L/min * 20 min)
* Volume = 400 L + 300 L
* Volume = 700 L

**Step 3:** Calculate the total volume of water in the pool.

* Since the pool is 70% full, the total volume of water is: 700 L * 1.7 = 1200 L

**Final Answer:** The total capacity of the pool is 1200 L. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Pipe A's fill:**  Pipe A fills for 30 minutes, so in 30 minutes it fills 20L/min * 30 min = 600L.

2. **Both pipes run together:** Together, they fill for 20 minutes. In 20 minutes, they fill 20L/min + 15L/min = 35L/min.  They fill 35L/min * 20 min = 700L

3. **Combined fill:** Pipe A fills 600L and both pipes fill 700L. So, total fill is 600L + 700L = 1300L

4. **Pool capacity:** Since the pool is now 70% full, it means it has 100% - 70% = 30% of its capacity left to be filled.

5. **Calculate remaining capacity:** 1300L * 0.30 = 390L


**Final Answer:** The total capacity of the pool is 1300L.

A jar contains red and blue marbles in a 3:5 ratio. After adding 10 red marbles, the ratio becomes 1:1. How many blue marbles were originally in the jar?
answer is 25
enter sampling
⚠️ Sampling slow: 99.7s, steps=300
get results from sampling



Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let  'x' represent the initial number of blue marbles.
* Since the ratio is 3:5, there are 3x/5 red marbles initially.

**2. Set Up the Equation**

*  The total number of red and blue marbles remains the same after adding red marbles. This means:
   *  3x/5 + 10 = (x + 10) 
  
**3. Solve for x**

* Simplify the equation: 3x/5 + 10 = x + 10
* Subtract 10 from both sides: 3x/5 = x
* Multiply both sides by 5: 3x = 5x
* Subtract 3x from both sides: 0 = 2x
* Divide both sides by 2: 0 = x

This result indicates that there is no logical solution, as the number of blue marbles cannot be zero.

**Final Answer:** There must be an error in the problem statement.  The ratio given doesn't make sense. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False
 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Initial ratio:** The original ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:5. This means for every 3 red marbles, there are 5 blue marbles. 

2. **Change in ratio:** After adding 10 red marbles, the ratio becomes 1:1. This means the ratio of red to blue marbles is now equal to 1:1.

3. **Number of marbles:** Since the ratio is now 1:1,  and we know the number of red marbles increased from 10 to 20, we need to calculate the total number of marbles. The initial ratio was 3:5 so we know 3 parts of red = 5 parts of blue. If we know that 3 parts of red make up 5 parts of blue then we can find out how many parts of blue were in the jar initially. 

4. **Determine the number of blue marbles:**  Let's use variables: 
    *  Let 'x' be the original number of blue marbles.
    *  The original number of red marbles is (5/3)*x 

5. **Work with the new ratio:**  We know the number of red and blue marbles after adding the 10 red marbles are now equal. So, (5/3)*x + 10 = x

6. **Solve for x:**  Simplify the equation
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Ratio:** The original ratio 3:5 means for every 3 red marbles, there are 5 blue marbles. 
2. **Adding Red Marbles:**  After adding 10 red marbles, the ratio becomes 1:1, which means for every 1 red marble, there is 1 blue marble. 
3. **Calculating the Original Ratio:**  Since the red marbles now equal the blue marbles after adding 10, the blue marbles must have been 10 less.
4. **Finding the Original Blue Marbles:** Since the ratio of blue to red marbles is 5:3 before the red marbles were added, the number of blue marbles must have been 5 times the number of red marbles.


**Final Answer:**  The original number of blue marbles was 15. 
reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Define variables:** Let's represent the original number of blue marbles as "5x".  Since the ratio is 3:5, the original number of red marbles is "3x".

2. **Set up the equations:**  
   -  The initial ratio represents a total of 8x blue and 15x red marbles (8x + 15x = 23x).

   - After adding the 10 red marbles, the ratio becomes 1:1.  We can represent the new number of red marbles as "x + 10", and the new number of blue marbles as "x".

   - The total number of marbles after adding 10 red marbles is 23x + 10 + 10 = 23x + 20. 

3. **Solve the equations:** 
   - The new ratio (1:1) can be expressed as 23x = 20.
   - Solving for x, we get x = 20/23

4. **Find the original number of blue marbles:** 
    -  Since the original number of blue marbles was 5x, then the original number of blue marbles is 5 * (20/23) = 100/23.

**Final answer:** 100/23
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True
 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Represent the ratio:** Let's say the original number of red marbles was 3x and blue marbles were 5x. 

2. **Formulate the equation:**  The initial ratio is 3:5.  Therefore, the total number of red and blue marbles would be 8x (3x + 5x).

3. **Consider the change:** After adding 10 red marbles, the ratio becomes 1:1. This means the total number of red and blue marbles is now 11x (10 + 3x + 5x).

4. **Solve for x:**  The total number of red and blue marbles remains the same, so we can write the equation: 8x = 11x. Solving for x, we get x = 0. This doesn't make sense, as there can't be zero marbles. We need to review our initial assumption about the ratio.

5. **Correcting the ratio:**  The ratio 3:5 means the number of red marbles is 3/8 of the total marbles. After adding 10 red marbles, this number must have increased. Let's adjust the ratio so that the total number of red and blue marbles becomes 11x after the addition. 

6. **Finding the blue marbles:**  With the new ratio, we can determine the number of

A sum of money doubles itself in 10 years at simple interest. What is the annual interest rate?
answer is 10
enter sampling
⚠️ Sampling slow: 91.6s, steps=300
get results from sampling


**Reasoning:**

1. **Simple Interest Formula:** The simple interest earned on a principal amount is given by:  
   I = P * R * T
   where:
     - I is the interest earned
     - P is the principal amount
     - R is the annual interest rate (in decimal form)
     - T is the time in years

2. **Finding the Interest:** Since the principal doubles itself in 10 years, the interest earned is (original principal) * 2.

3. **Combining the Formula:** We can substitute the interest earned into the simple interest formula:
   (original principal) * 2 = P * R * T

4. **Solving for R:** We know that T = 10 years.  Let's express R in terms of the original principal and T: 
   R = (original principal) / (P * T) 

5. **Calculating Interest:** We can find the interest earned by multiplying the original principal by the annual interest rate: 
    I = P * R * T 
    I = P * [(original principal) / (P * T)] * T
    I = P * (original principal) / (P * T) * T

6. **Simplifying:** We can cancel out some terms to get: 
    I = 2 * (original principal)

Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Doubling:** The money doubles in 10 years, which means it grew to double its original amount.
* **Simple Interest:**  Simple interest is calculated using the formula: Interest = (Principal x Rate x Time) / 100
* **Finding the Rate:** We need to find the annual interest rate (Rate) that will cause the principal to double in 10 years.


**Step-by-Step Reasoning**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   * Let 'Principal' be the original amount of money.
   * Let 'Interest Rate' be the annual rate (in percentage).
   * Let 'Time' be the period for which interest is calculated, which is 10 years.

2. **Write the Formula:**  The interest earned in 10 years is double the principal amount. So, we can write the equation as:
   * Principal x (Rate x 10) / 100 = 2 * Principal

3. **Simplify the Equation:**  
   * (Rate x 10) / 100 = 2
   * Rate x 10 = 200
   * Rate = 20

4. **Calculate the Annual Rate:**
   * The annual interest rate (Rate) is 20%.


reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True


**Reasoning:**

1. **Understand the concepts:**
   - Simple interest is calculated on the principal amount only.
   - The amount doubles in 10 years, which means the principal plus interest amount at the end of 10 years is twice the original principal.

2. **Formulate an equation:**
   - Let the principal amount be 'P'.
   - The interest earned in 10 years is 'I'.
   - Simple interest = (Principal * Interest Rate * Time) / 100
   - Therefore, I = (P * R * 10) / 100, where R is the annual interest rate.

3. **Solve for the annual interest rate (R):**
   - At the end of 10 years, the amount becomes 2P.
   - We know the interest earned in 10 years is I.
   - Therefore, 2P = P + I 
   - Simplify the equation to: P = I
   - Substitute the formula for simple interest into the equation: I = (P * R * 10) / 100
   - Substitute P with I and solve for R: I = (I * R * 10) / 100
   - Simplify: 10I = 10R * I
   - Since I can be any amount, it

**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding Simple Interest:** Simple interest is calculated as (Principal * Rate * Time)/100. 
2. **Let's Represent the Variables:**
    * Let the Principal be "P"
    * Let the annual interest rate be "R" 
    * Let the time be "t" = 10 years
3. **Calculate the Simple Interest:**  Since the principal doubles itself, the final amount is 2P. 
    * 2P = P * R * 10 
4. **Simplify the Equation:** 
    * 2 = R * 10
    * R = 2/10
5. **Calculate the Annual Interest Rate:**
    * R = 0.2 or 20%

**Final Answer:** The annual interest rate is 20%. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the concept:** Simple interest means that the interest earned is directly proportional to the principal amount.  This implies that the interest is always calculated on the original principal amount.

2. **Formulating the equation:**  Let the principal amount be P, the interest rate be R, and the time period be T.  
   The simple interest formula is: Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 
   Therefore, the principal amount after T years will be: Principal + Interest.  

3. **Applying the given information:** We know the principal amount doubles itself in 10 years, so after 10 years, the principal will be 2P.  Using the formula above:
   2P = P + (P * R * 10) / 100
   
4. **Solving for R:**
   Simplify the equation: 2P = P + 0.1PR
   Combine terms: P = 0.1PR
   Solve for R: R = 2 

**Final answer:** The annual interest rate is 2%.

answer is -1
enter sampling
⚠️ Sampling slow: 85.0s, steps=259
get results from sampling


**Reasoning:**

1. **Increase by 10%:** The worker's salary increases by 10%, so the new salary is 110% of the original salary. 
2. **Decrease by 10%:** The worker's salary is then decreased by 10%, so the net salary is 90% of the new salary (110% - 10% = 100% of the original salary).

**Final Answer:** 
The net percentage change in the salary is **-10%**. 



reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Increase by 10%:**  The salary is increased by 10%, so the new salary is 110% of the original salary.
2. **Decrease by 10%:** The new salary (110% of the original salary) is then decreased by 10%, resulting in 90% of the original salary.
3. **Net change:**  The net change is the difference between the final salary and the original salary. In this case, the net change is 10% of the original salary.

**Final Answer:** The net percentage change is **-10%**. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Increase by 10%:**  The worker's salary increases by 10% of its original amount. This means the new salary is 110% of the original salary (100% + 10%).

2. **Decrease by 10%:** The worker's new salary (110% of the original) is then decreased by 10%. This means the final salary is 90% of the new salary (100% - 10%).

3. **Calculate the net percentage change:**  To find the net percentage change, we need to find the percentage difference between the final salary and the original salary. The net percentage change is:

   [(Final Salary - Original Salary) / Original Salary] * 100%

   [(90% - 100%) / 100%] * 100%  =  (-10% / 100%) * 100% = -100%

**Final Answer:** The net percentage change in the salary is -100%, which means the salary has been reduced by 100%. 

reward is -1.1

**Reasoning:**

1. **Initial Increase:** The salary is increased by 10%, so the new salary is 110% of the original salary. 
2. **Decrease:** The new salary is then decreased by 10%, which means the final salary is 90% of the new salary.
3. **Calculation:** To find the net change, we need to calculate the difference between the final and initial salaries. 

Let's put it into steps:

a. **Increase:** The salary increased by 10%, so it's 1.10 times the original amount. 
b. **Decrease:** The increased amount is then decreased by 10%, so it's 0.90 times the new salary. 
c. **Net Change:** The net change is calculated by finding the difference between 0.90 times the new salary and the original salary. 


**Final Answer:**

The net percentage change in the salary is **-10%**.

answer is 156
enter sampling
⚠️ Sampling slow: 84.6s, steps=292
get results from sampling


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the area of the garden:**  Area = length x width = 20m x 15m = 300 square meters.
2. **Calculate the perimeter of the garden:** Perimeter = 2 x (length + width) = 2 x (20m + 15m) = 2 x 35m = 70m
3. **Calculate the length and width of the garden including the path:** 
   - Length = 70m (garden perimeter) - 2 x 2m (path width) = 66m
   - Width = 15m (original width) 
4. **Calculate the area of the garden including the path:** Area = length x width = 66m x 15m = 990 square meters.
5. **Calculate the area of the path:** Area of path = Area of garden - Area of garden including the path = 300 square meters - 990 square meters = -690 square meters. 


**Final Answer:** 
The result is -690 square meters. 

**Important Note:**  The area of the path cannot be negative. This indicates that the provided dimensions are impossible. It's possible there is an error in the provided dimensions.

2. **Area of the garden with path:** The path's outer perimeter is 20m + 2m + 15m = 37m. So the path's area is 37m * 2m = 74 square meters.

3. **Area of the path:** The area of the path is 74 square meters.

**Final answer:** 74 square meters 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False
 

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the dimensions of the garden with the path:**
   * The garden's perimeter without the path is 20m + 15m = 35m
   * Since the path is 2m wide, the total perimeter includes 2m x 2 = 4m  
   * The total perimeter of the garden with the path is 35m + 4m = 39m
   *  The total length of the garden is 20m, and the total width is 15m 

2. **Calculate the area of the garden:**
   * Area = length x width = 20m x 15m = 300 m²

3. **Calculate the area of the path:**
   * Area of path = total area - area of the garden
   * Area of path = 39m² - 300 m² = -261 m²

**Final Answer:**  The area of the path is **-261 m²**.  **Note:** This answer is impossible, as the area of a path cannot be negative. There might be an error in the provided dimensions or calculations. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False
 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Area of the garden:**  The garden's area is length x width = 20m x 15m = 300 sq.m
2. **Perimeter of the garden:** The perimeter of the garden is 2(length + width) = 2(20m + 15m) = 70m
3. **Length of the path:** The path is 2m wide, so its length is 70m - 2(20m + 15m) = 70m - 70m = 0m. 
4. **Area of the path:** The path has no area as its length is 0.


**Final answer:** 0 sq.m 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Find the area of the garden:** The area of a rectangle is length * width, so the area of the garden is 20m * 15m = 300 square meters.

2. **Find the perimeter of the garden:** The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width), so the perimeter of the garden is 2 * (20m + 15m) = 70m.

3. **Find the length and width of the garden after adding the path:** The path is 2m wide, so the length of the garden plus the path is 20m + 2m = 22m. The width of the garden plus the path is 15m + 2m = 17m.

4. **Calculate the area of the path:** The area of a rectangle is length * width, so the area of the path is 22m * 17m = 374 square meters.

**Final Answer:** The area of the path is 374 square meters.

**Reasoning**

1. **Calculate daily reading after the increase:** 20 pages/day * 1.50 (50% increase) = 30 pages/day
2. **Calculate pages read in 5 days after the increase:** 30 pages/day * 5 days = 150 pages
3. **Calculate pages remaining:** 250 pages - 150 pages = 100 pages
4. **Calculate the number of days to finish the remaining pages:** 100 pages / 30 pages/day = 3.33 days

**Final Answer:** It will take the student 3.33 days to finish the book. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False



**Step 1: Calculate the daily reading rate after the increase.**

* The student increases her rate by 50%, so her new reading rate is 20 * 1.50 = 30 pages per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total pages read in 5 days after the increase.**

* Over 5 days, she reads 30 * 5 = 150 pages.

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining pages.**

* The student has 250 - 150 = 100 pages remaining.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of days to finish the remaining pages.**

* To finish the remaining 100 pages, she needs 100 / 30 = 3.33 days.

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of days to finish the book.**

* Since she needs 3.33 days to finish the remaining pages, she will need a total of 5 + 3.33 = 8.33 days.

   - The tank is 1/3 full, so the volume of water is (1/3) * 1386 m³ = 462 m³

**Final Answer:** 462 cubic meters of water are in the tank. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning**

1. **Find the volume of the full tank:**
   - The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h
   - Full tank volume = (22/7) * (3m)² * 7m = 132 m³

2. **Find the volume of water in the tank:**
   - The tank is 1/3 full, so the volume of water is (1/3) * 132 m³ = 44 m³

**Final answer:** 44 cubic meters of water are in the tank.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the total cost:** The bike cost $400 + $100 = $500
2. **Calculate the profit:** A 25% profit on $500 is (25/100) * $500 = $125.
3. **Calculate the selling price:** The selling price is the total cost plus the profit: $500 + $125 = $625

**Final answer:** $625 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the total cost:** The initial cost of the bike is $400, and the repairs cost an additional $100, so the total cost is $400 + $100 = $500.
2. **Calculate the profit:** A 25% profit means the person earned 0.25 (25/100) of the total cost as profit. 
3. **Calculate the selling price:** The selling price is the total cost plus the profit.  

**Final answer:**  $625 

reward is 0.9

A rectangular field has an area of 300 square meters. If the length is 3 times the width, what is the perimeter of the field?
answer is 80
enter sampling
⚠️ Sampling slow: 139.9s, steps=300
get results from sampling


**Reasoning:**

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'w' represent the width of the field.
   * Let 'l' represent the length of the field.

2. **Set up equations:**
   * We know l = 3w (length is 3 times the width).
   * We know the area is 300 square meters: l * w = 300

3. **Substitute:**
   * Since l = 3w, substitute this into the area equation: (3w) * w = 300
   * Simplify: 3w² = 300
   * Divide both sides by 3: w² = 100
   * Take the square root of both sides: w = 10 meters

4. **Calculate the length:**
   * l = 3w = 3 * 10 = 30 meters

5. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   * Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (30 + 10) = 2 * 40 = 80 meters

**Final Answer:** The perimeter of the field is 80 meters. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let the width of the field be 'w' meters.
   * The length is 3 times the width, so the length is '3w' meters.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   * Area of a rectangle = length * width
   * 300 = (3w) * w
   * 300 = 3w²
   * w² = 100 
   * w = √100 = 10 meters

3. **Calculate the length:**
   * Length = 3 * width = 3 * 10 = 30 meters

4. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   * Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
   * Perimeter = 2 * (30 + 10) = 2 * 40 = 80 meters

**Final Answer:** The perimeter of the field is 80 meters. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Let's represent the variables:**
   * Let the width of the field be "w" meters.
   * Let the length of the field be "3w" meters (since the length is 3 times the width).

2. **Use the area formula:** 
   * The area of a rectangle is length * width.
   * We know the area is 300 square meters, so:  (3w) * w = 300

3. **Solve for the width:**
   * 3w² = 300
   * w² = 100
   * w = √100 = 10 meters

4. **Calculate the length:**
   * Length = 3 * width = 3 * 10 = 30 meters

5. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   * Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 * (length + width)
   * Perimeter = 2 * (30 + 10) = 2 * 40 = 80 meters

**Final Answer:** The perimeter of the field is 80 meters. 

reward is 0.9

**Reasoning:**

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'w' represent the width of the field.
   * Let 'l' represent the length of the field.

2. **Set up equations:**
   * We know that the area is 300 square meters:  l * w = 300
   * We also know that the length is 3 times the width:  l = 3w

3. **Solve for the width (w):** 
   * Substitute the value of 'l' from the second equation into the first equation: 3w * w = 300
   * Simplify: 3w² = 300
   * Divide both sides by 3: w² = 100
   * Take the square root of both sides: w = 10 meters

4. **Solve for the length (l):**
   * Substitute the value of 'w' back into either equation. Let's use l = 3w: l = 3 * 10 = 30 meters

5. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   * Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) 
   * Perimeter = 2 * (30 + 10) 
   * Perimeter = 2 * 40 = 80 meters

**Final answer:** The perimeter of the field

is result truncated? True


**Step 1: Define variables**

* Let 'w' represent the width of the field.
* Let 'l' represent the length of the field.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information**

* We know that the area is 300 square meters:  l * w = 300
* We also know that the length is 3 times the width: l = 3w

**Step 3: Substitute to solve for the variables**

* Substitute the value of 'l' from the second equation into the first equation: (3w) * w = 300
* Simplify: 3w² = 300
* Divide both sides by 3: w² = 100
* Take the square root of both sides: w = 10 meters 

* Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'l': l = 3 * 10 meters = 30 meters

**Step 4: Calculate the perimeter**

* Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 * (length + width)
* Perimeter = 2 * (30 meters + 10 meters)
* Perimeter = 2 * 40 meters
* Perimeter = 80 meters

**Final answer:** The perimeter of the field is 80 meters.

* Let the son's current age be 's'

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information**

* "The person is 3 times as old as his son" :  f = 3s
* "In 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son" : f + 12 = 2(s + 12)

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations**

* **Substitute** the first equation (f = 3s) into the second equation: 3s + 12 = 2(s + 12)
* **Simplify** and solve for 's': 3s + 12 = 2s + 24  =>  s = 12
* **Substitute** the value of 's' back into the first equation to find 'f': f = 3 * 12  =>  f = 36

**Final Answer:** The father is currently 36 years old.

**Step 1: Define variables**

Let the father's current age be "f" 
Let the son's current age be "s"

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information**

* "Person is 3 times as old as his son":  f = 3s
* "In 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son": f + 12 = 2(s + 12)

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations**

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
3s + 12 = 2(s + 12)
3s + 12 = 2s + 24
s = 12

Now that we know the son's age (s = 12), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find the father's age:
f = 3 * 12
f = 36

**Reasoning**

1. **Determine the cost per pen:**
   * Pens in packs of 5: $2 / 5 pens = $0.40 per pen
   * Pens in packs of 12: $4.50 / 12 pens = $0.375 per pen

2. **Calculate the cost for 50 pens using both pack options:**
   * Packs of 5: 50 pens / 5 pens/pack = 10 packs, cost: 10 packs * $0.40/pack = $4.00
   * Packs of 12: 50 pens / 12 pens/pack = 4.1667 packs, cost: 4.1667 packs * $0.375/pack = $1.50

3. **Determine the minimum cost:**
   * The minimum cost to buy 50 pens is $1.50

**Final answer:** $1.50

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the cost per pen for the two pack sizes:**
   - Pack of 5: $2 / 5 pens = $0.40 per pen
   - Pack of 12: $4.50 / 12 pens = $0.375 per pen

2. **Determine the number of packs needed:**
   - Since we need 50 pens, we need to figure out which pack size (5 or 12) will give us enough to reach 50.
   - We can divide 50 by 5 to find out how many packs of 5 we need: 50 / 5 = 10 packs.
   -  We can divide 50 by 12 to find out how many packs of 12 we need: 50 / 12 = 4.17. We can't buy part of a pack. So we need 4 packs of 12.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost from packs of 5: 10 packs * $0.40/pack = $4.00
   - Cost from packs of 12: 4 packs * $4.50/pack = $18.00

4. **Sum the costs:**
   - Total Cost: $4.00
reward is -1.3
is result truncated? True
 

**Reasoning**

1. **Calculate the cost per pen:**
   - For packs of 5: $2 / 5 pens = $0.40 per pen
   - For packs of 12: $4.50 / 12 pens = $0.375 per pen

2. **Determine the cheaper option:**
   - The cheaper option is to buy packs of 5, as it costs $0.40 per pen.

3. **Calculate the number of packs needed:**
   - 50 pens / 5 pens per pack = 10 packs

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - 10 packs * $2/pack = $20

**Final answer:** The minimum cost to buy 50 pens is $20.

**Reasoning**

1. **Calculate the cost per pen:**
   * For packs of 5: $2 / 5 pens = $0.40 per pen
   * For packs of 12: $4.50 / 12 pens = $0.375 per pen

2. **Determine the cheapest pack to reach 50 pens:**
   * Calculate the number of packs needed for 50 pens using each pack size:
      * Packs of 5: 50 pens / 5 pens/pack = 10 packs
      * Packs of 12: 50 pens / 12 pens/pack = 4.17 packs (round up to 5 packs)
   * Compare the cost of each pack:
      * 10 packs of 5 = 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
      * 5 packs of 12 = 5 * $0.375 = $1.875

3. **The minimum cost:**
     * The minimum cost is $1.875, which you get by buying 5 packs of 12.


**Final answer:** $1.875

   - 60% / 4 hours = 15% per hour

2. **Calculate the remaining battery life in minutes:**
   - 15% per hour * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

3. **Calculate the remaining time until reaching 0%:**
   - 100% - 40% = 60%
   - 60% / 15% per hour = 4 hours
   - 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes


**Final answer:** 240 minutes

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the battery's percentage decline per hour:** 100% - 40% = 60%
   * The battery loses 60% of its charge every 1 hour. 

2. **Calculate the percentage of charge remaining after 4 hours:** 100% - (60% * 4 hours) = 100% - 240% 
   * The battery has 100% - 240% = -140% of charge remaining after 4 hours.
3. **Calculate the remaining minutes:** 
   * Since the battery is at -140%, it implies that it's lost all its charge.


**Final Answer:** The battery will last 0 minutes before reaching 0%. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Calculate the battery capacity lost per hour:**
   * The battery drops from 100% to 40% in 4 hours, meaning it lost 60% (100% - 40%) of its charge.
   * Capacity lost per hour: 60% / 4 hours = 15% per hour

2. **Calculate the remaining battery life:**
   * The battery is currently at 40% and loses 15% per hour.
   * Remaining battery life: 40% - (15% * 2 hours) = 40% - 30% = 10%

3. **Calculate the remaining battery life in minutes:**
   * 10% represents 10/100 = 0.1 of the battery.
   * Time to reach 0% = 0.1 * 60 minutes/hour = 6 minutes

**Final answer:** The battery will last for **6 more minutes** before reaching 0%. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Step 1: Calculate the battery's capacity loss per hour.**
* The battery drops from 100% to 40% which is a 60% loss.
* Capacity loss per hour = (60% / 4 hours) = 15% per hour

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining battery life.**
* The battery has 60% capacity left. 
* Battery life remaining = 60% 

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining battery life in minutes.**
* 60% of the battery's capacity in minutes is equal to the percentage of battery remaining.
* Remaining battery life in minutes = (60%) * (60 minutes per hour) * 4 hours = 1440 minutes.

**Final answer: 1440 minutes** 

reward is -1.1

**Step 1: Calculate the battery capacity used in 1 hour.**

* The battery drops from 100% to 40%, which means it lost 60% of its capacity (100% - 40% = 60%).
* In one hour, the battery used 60% / 4 hours = 15% of its capacity.

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining battery capacity.**

* The battery started with 100% capacity and used 15% in an hour, leaving 100% - 15% = 85% capacity.

**Step 3: Calculate the battery's remaining capacity in minutes.**

* 1 minute contains 60 seconds.
*  85% of the capacity is equivalent to 85/100 * 100% = 85 minutes. 

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining time until 0%**

* The battery will last 85 minutes before reaching 0%.


**Final Answer: 85 minutes.**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Find the initial number of apples:** Since the ratio of apples to oranges is 2:3, and there are 30 fruits in total, there are (30 / 5) = 6 apples.
2. **Find the initial number of oranges:** There are 30 - 6 = 24 oranges.
3. **Calculate the new number of apples:** The ratio of apples to oranges is 1:2, so we need to find how many apples to add. The new number of apples is (1 * 24) = 24.
4. **Calculate the new number of oranges:** We need to add 24 - 24 = 0 oranges to make the ratio 1:2.

**Final Answer:** 0 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the initial number of apples:**  Since the ratio of apples to oranges is 2:3, the initial number of apples is 2/5 * 30 = 12 apples.
2. **Calculate the initial number of oranges:** The initial number of fruits is 30, and there are 12 apples, so the initial number of oranges is 30 - 12 = 18 oranges.
3. **Calculate the number of oranges needed:** We want the ratio to be 1:2, so we need to increase the number of oranges. 
4. **Calculate the new number of oranges:** Since the ratio is 1:2, the new number of oranges should be 2 * (30 - 12) = 36 oranges.
5. **Calculate the new number of oranges:** The new number of oranges is 36.
 

**Final answer:** 36 oranges. 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the initial number of apples:**  The ratio 2:3 means that for every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges.  Since there are 30 fruits total, let 'x' be the number of apples initially. Then, (3/2)x = the number of oranges initially. 
2. **Set up an equation:** The total number of fruits is 30, so  x + (3/2)x = 30
3. **Solve for x:** Combine like terms: (5/2)x = 30
   * Multiply both sides by (2/5): x = 12
4. **Calculate the number of oranges:**  Since there are 3 oranges for every 2 apples, there are (3/2) * 12 = 18 oranges initially.
5. **Determine the number of oranges needed:** To get a ratio of 1:2, we need to add oranges to reach 18 + x = 18 + 12 = 30 fruits.
6. **Calculate the number of oranges to add:** Since we want a ratio of 1:2, and there are already 18 oranges, we need to add 12 oranges.


**Final answer:** 12 oranges 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


**Step 1:**  Find the initial amount of apples.  
We know the ratio is 2:3, and the total number of fruits is 30.  
* The ratio represents the parts, so we can think of it as 2 parts apples + 3 parts oranges.
* The total parts are 2 + 3 = 5.
* Since there are 30 fruits in total, each part represents 30/5 = 6 fruits. 
* The number of apples is 2 * 6 = 12.

**Step 2:**  Calculate the initial amount of oranges.  
* The total number of fruits is 30. 
* The number of apples is 12, so the number of oranges is 30 - 12 = 18.

**Step 3:**  Find the number of oranges needed to make the ratio 1:2.  
* We want to change the ratio from 2:3 to 1:2. 
* The ratio 1:2 means we need to add oranges to make the ratio equivalent. 
* The initial number of oranges was 18. To make the ratio 1:2, we need to add 18 * 2 = 36 oranges.


**Final answer:** 36 

reward is -1.1
is result truncated? False


Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the initial number of apples:**

* The ratio of apples to oranges is 2:3, meaning for every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges.
* The total ratio parts are 2 + 3 = 5
* Since there are 30 fruits in total, the value of one part is 30/5 = 6 fruits.
* There are 2 parts for apples, so there are 2 * 6 = 12 apples.

**2. Find the initial number of oranges:**

* There are 3 parts for oranges, so there are 3 * 6 = 18 oranges.

**3. Determine the new number of fruits needed:**

* The ratio needs to be 1:2, meaning for every 1 fruit of apples, there are 2 fruits of oranges.
* The new total ratio parts are 1 + 2 = 3
* The new value of one part is 30/3 = 10 fruits.
* To get 10 fruits for each part, we need to add 10 * 18 = 180 fruits of oranges.

**Final answer:** 180 oranges must be added to the basket.

get results from sampling


**Step-by-Step Reasoning**

1. **Define Variables:** 
   * Let 'm' represent the number of miles driven.

2. **Create an equation:**
   * The total cost is the rental fee plus the mileage fee: $64 = $40 + 0.20m

3. **Solve for 'm':**
   * Subtract $40 from both sides: $24 = 0.20m
   * Divide both sides by 0.20: m = 120

**Final Answer:** 120 miles were driven. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False
 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the cost of renting the car:** We know the daily rental fee is $40. So, the cost of renting the car for one day is $40.
2. **Set up an equation:** Let 'x' represent the number of miles driven. The cost of renting the car plus the cost of miles driven is $64. So, the equation is: $40 + $0.20x = $64
3. **Solve for x:**
    * Subtract $40 from both sides: $0.20x = $24
    * Divide both sides by $0.20: x = 120

**Final answer:** 120 miles were driven. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Step 1:**  Let 'm' be the number of miles driven. 

**Step 2:** Set up an equation: $40 (daily rate) + $0.20m (miles) = $64 (total bill)

**Step 3:** Substitute the known values: $40 + $0.20m = $64

**Step 4:** Subtract $40 from both sides: $0.20m = $24

**Step 5:** Divide both sides by $0.20: m = 120

**Final answer:** The car was driven 120 miles. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Step 1: Define variables**

Let  'x' represent the number of miles driven.

**Step 2: Set up the equation**

The total cost of renting a car for one day is the sum of the daily rental fee and the mileage charge.  We can write this as an equation:

$64 = $40 + $0.20x

**Step 3: Solve the equation for x**

* Subtract $40 from both sides of the equation:  
   $24 = $0.20x
* Divide both sides by $0.20:
   x = 120

**Final Answer: **  The car was driven for 120 miles. 

reward is 0.9
is result truncated? False


**Step 1:  Define variables.**

* Let *x* represent the number of miles driven.

$64 = $40 + $0.20x

**Step 3:  Solve for x.**

* Subtract $40 from both sides: $24 = $0.20x
* Divide both sides by $0.20: x = 120

**Final answer:** The car was driven 120 miles.

⚠️ Sampling slow: 55.3s, steps=182
get results from sampling


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the side length:**
   - A square's perimeter is found by adding up the lengths of all four sides.
   - Perimeter = 4 * side 
   - 32cm = 4 * side
   - side = 32cm / 4
   - side = 8cm

2. **Double the side length:**
   - Double the side = 8cm * 2 = 16cm

3. **Find the new area:**
   - Area of a square = side * side
   - New area = 16cm * 16cm
   - New area = 256cm² 

**Final answer:** The new area will be 256 square centimeters.

   - So, the side length of the original square is 32 cm / 4 = 8 cm.

2. **Double the side length:**
   - Doubling the side length gives us 8 cm * 2 = 16 cm.

3. **Calculate the new area:**
   - The area of a square is the square of its side length.
   - The new area is 16 cm * 16 cm = 256 cm². 


**Final answer:** The new area will be 256 cm².

get results from sampling


**Step 1: Define variables**

* Let  'n' represent the number of nickels.
* Let 'd' represent the number of dimes.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information**

*  We know that the total number of coins is 50:  n + d = 50
*  We know the total value is $3.50: 0.05n + 0.10d = 3.50 

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations**

One way to solve is using substitution:

1. **Solve for 'n' in the first equation:**  n = 50 - d
2. **Substitute this value of 'n' into the second equation:** 0.05(50 - d) + 0.10d = 3.50
3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**  2.5 - 0.05d + 0.10d = 3.50 => 0.05d = 1.00 => d = 20
4. **Substitute the value of 'd' back into the equation for 'n':** n = 50 - 20 => n = 30

**Final Answer:** There are 30 nickels.

**Step 1:** Calculate the price increase. 
   - Original price: Let's say the original price is $x.
   - Price increase: 20% of $x = 0.20x

**Step 2:** Calculate the new price after the increase.
   - New price: $x + 0.20x = 1.20x

**Step 3:** Calculate the discount.
   - Discount: 20% of $1.20x = 0.20

is result truncated? True


**Step 1:** Calculate the price increase. 
The price is increased by 20%, so the increase is 0.20 * original price.

**Step 2:** Calculate the new price after the increase.
The new price is the original price plus the increase: original price + 0.20 * original price = 1.20 * original price.

**Step 3:** Calculate the discount.
The discount is 20% of the new price: 0.20 * 1.20 *

**Reasoning:**

1. **Price increase:** The price increases by 20% of the original price, let's say the original price is 'x'. So the new price is 1.20x. 
2. **Price after discount:**  The store then offers a 20% discount on the new price, which is 1.20x.  So the final price is 0.80 * 1.20x = 0.96x.
