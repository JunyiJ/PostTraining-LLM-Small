[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at 62 km/h**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled at 124 km/h**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance**

* Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
* Total Distance = 124 km + 372 km = 496 km

**Answer:** The total distance traveled is 496 km.

[eval] A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km. -> A car travels at 62 km/h for 2 hours, then twice that speed for 3 hours. Compute total distance in km.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate distance for the first part**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 62 km/h * 2 h 
* Distance = 124 km

**Step 2: Calculate distance for the second part**

* Speed = 62 km/h * 2 = 124 km/h
* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 124 km/h * 3 h
* Distance = 372 km

**Step 3: Calculate total distance**

* Total distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
* Total distance = 124 km + 372 km
* Total distance = 496 km

**Answer:** The total distance traveled is 496 km.
